        <p>Common sense is the normal way our minds and senses function. Without language, for example, if we were to be raised by wolves, common sense is all that would be left. All philosophy is language. Hence, no language, no philosophy. This means that the only valid philosophies are those that do not contradict common sense too much.</p>
        <p>Take a simple example. If you are walking in the forest and see a bear and her cubs, you should, and surely would be quite scared. You might carefully walk away, hoping she doesn't see you. You would then turn your back so you can climb up a small rock face, knowing your car is parked over the hill. Now, we can surely agree that this is the most basic function of the mind and senses: keep you safe, keep track of safety and danger. In this scenario, you knew the bear is dangerous, where she was, and where your escape was. If the skeptics and idealists were correct, then all of this data is faulty. This would mean that your fundamental, basic mind and senses are faulty. This would also mean that any data they build or receive is also faulty, which means that these senses and mind telling you that they have learned that they are faulty cannot be believed, since it would be faulty data. </p>
           
            <p>In a callback to the <a href="./crepes.html">Idealism</a> page, it is also worth mentioning that the exact same problem crops up in physics. If one ostensibly proved that only what is observed at the moment actually exists, that nothing else does when out of mind, that all is dependent on consciousness, or similar, then this would also prove that the fundamental apparatus that built this experiment and position, the mind and senses, are fundamentally, and hopelessly invalid. The mind and senses that tell one, even if one doesn't know language at all, where danger is, where safety is, and so on, like the bear, the hill, and the car in the above example, are the same mind and senses that did, or learned about the experiment. These mind and senses are irretrievably flawed, in this scenario, and, in reality, there was no bear behind you, and no hill to climb, and no car ahead for safety, except when you saw them. Thus, turn your back on the bear, and it cannot kill you, which no sane person would believe. Yet, if this were ostensibly proven true, we have to admit that the mind and senses apparatus is completely discredited, and does not present an even remotely accurate picture of the world. Now, if the fundamental way the mind and senses work is completely false, then how could we possibly believe that this mind and sense apparatus is correct about the experiment? We can't, and would need to conclude that it cannot provide valid data. There is no rational reason to believe that an apparatus that is that faulty can provide reliable data. Thus, the experiment proves that the data is faulty, due to being built by a deeply, completely flawed apparatus that simply doesn't give a true picture of reality. Even though the experiment relies heavily on mathematics, these mathematics are understood with this completely unreliable apparatus. An apparatus that cannot tell the difference between such a simple thing as a bear that exists, and therefore requires fleeing to safety, and one that disappears when you turn around cannot be trusted in its understanding things that are exponentially more complex. And so, the experiment disproves itself. </p>


            <p>As an aside, it is worth mentioning that some critiquing of the mind and senses, of course, is valid. The point isn't that the mind and senses are entirely infallible. The point is that they are for the most part reliable, and even when they don't depict reality exactly as other sensing devices or beings might, it is still built upon reality, and is depicting it with reasonable fidelity. Put differently, we might note that the human eye sees water where there is none, as with the mirage, and thus sometimes the senses mistake falsehood for reality. However, we cannot claim that the human mind and senses see nothing but falsehood, because that would make the statement "the human mind and senses see nothing but falsehood" a falsehood!</p>


            <p>"You cannot prove something to be erroneous with an erroneous proof."
                -Stafford L. Betty
              </p>
               
                <p>With all of that in mind, we are left with two choices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The mind and senses are unimpeachable, at least within reason, and broadly speaking. To undercut them and invalidate them entirely is to collapse the entire scaffolding that any argument seeking to do so would necessarily, and inescapably stand on.</li>
            <li>One must have no position whatsoever, because a person who has faulted the foundations of 100% of their own knowledge cannot have a position that is valid.</li>
        </ol>
<p>Considering the fact that most of us want to have some kind of position on the world, we might decide that the likes of Epicurus, Diogenes, Kumarila Bhatta, or other philosophers who declared the common sense world as real are who we might agree with. That said, of course some may decide they don't care about philosophy, and will go with having no position at all. This is completely valid! The key is to make sure one doesn't slip into becoming a walking embarrassment of self refutation. This happens when one declares they have no philosophy, but then blathers on ad infinitum about what they believe, and why other philosophies are wrong. We cannot have our cake and eat it too in the world of philosophy! If one declares that all is unreal, or that they do not believe anything, then they give up all validity of their own arguments, and must just shrug these things off. </p>
<p>Again, though, this is valid! There was a group in ancient India called the Ajnana. Their position was that they simply didn't know! There is nothing wrong with this. The fault is saying that you know that nothing can be known, that nothing is real, that everything is relative, and similar, because each one of these self refutes. However, stating that you simply don't know is a perfectly safe and rational position (and, indeed, some Ajnana did go too far in this direction, and it was noted by others that they self refuted). The position of not knowing looks something like this:</p>

<p>"I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that."
    -Digha Nikaya 1
</p>

<p>Anything that challenges common sense also challenges and then defeats itself. Common sense is, by definition, all we have. This is because, while we like to imagine that we have gotten far beyond mere common sense, this common sense is still the foundation for all knowledge. It is inextricably bound to everything that we are and can conceive of. To turn the sword of philosophy on common sense is to turn the sword on one's own position, and kill it.</p>

<p>"If everyday experience poses no threat to you, then you may persist in this denial of the evidence provided by such experience. Quarrel with the evidence of everyday experience, and afterward we will rely on the winner."
    -Chandrakirti, The Emptiness of Emptiness, translated by C.W. Huntington
</p>

<p>I might also note that there have been philosophers who point out that many philosophies actually create the problems they seek to solve through a misuse of language. This is known as ordinary language philosophy. An example of this might be "What is right and wrong?" Epicurus famously noted that things that cause physical pain are wrong. Any rational person can agree that they do not want to be injured, and that we are hard wired to see this as "wrong." When we give this answer to most philosophical minded people, though, we see an example of misuse of language in the reply, "No, I mean, ultimately, like, objectively, what is right and wrong?" this creates an unsolvable riddle that only appears to be a legitimate question. Answering it would require words, and concepts, to exist as abstract entities floating out in space or something. In reality it is no different than a Zen koan, like the famous "What is, is what?" koan from the Gateless Gate. Yet, while the koan is supposed to lead to enlightenment, misuse of language to create ostensibly solvable philosophical problems is just a way to keep philosophers in business forever. </p>  

<p>"The later Wittgenstein held that the meanings of words reside in their ordinary uses and that this is why philosophers trip over words taken in abstraction. From this came the idea that philosophy had gotten into trouble by trying to use words outside of the context of their use in ordinary language. For example, "understanding" is what you mean when you say "I understand". "Knowledge" is what you mean when you say "I know". The point is that you already know what "understanding" or "knowledge" are, at least implicitly. Philosophers are ill-advised to construct new definitions of these terms, because this is necessarily a redefinition, and the argument may unravel into self-referential nonsense. Rather, philosophers must explore the definitions these terms already have, without forcing convenient redefinitions onto them."
    -Wikipedia page on "Ordinary Language Philosophy"
</p>

<p>"For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to be sought. They might perhaps have discovered the essentials, had they not sought the superfluous also. They lost much time in quibbling about words and in sophistical argumentation; all that sort of thing exercises the wit to no purpose. We tie knots and bind up words in double meanings, and then try to untie them. Have we leisure enough for this? Do we already know how to live, or die? We should rather proceed with our whole souls towards the point where it is our duty to take heed lest things, as well as words, deceive us. Why, pray, do you discriminate between similar words, when nobody is ever deceived by them except during the discussion? It is things that lead us astray: it is between things that you must discriminate."
    -Seneca

<p>Honorable mention need be made for the different versions of hedonism, if nothing else than to clear up a common misconception. Epicurus was a hedonist, and Epicureanism is hedonistic. Most picture a lunatic, drunk, promiscuous person, who eats constantly and lays around with a bowl of grapes on their stomach when they think "hednoist." Something like this:</p>

<img class="hedonism" src="https://theinfosphere.org/images/thumb/8/82/Hedonism_Bot.jpg/225px-Hedonism_Bot.jpg" alt="And image of hedonism bot from the show Futurama">

<p>On the contrary, though, the word can also denote someone like Epicurus, who, despite being smeared as the above, was, in reality, chaste, moderate in food and drink, avoided violence and politics, and was, by most modern standards, a reserved, reasonable fellow, and so he designed his philosophy, as well. Thus, we see, there is variety in the word. Now, of course, there were others, for example, the Chavarka:</p>



<p>"There is no world other than this;
    There is no heaven and no hell;
    The realm of Shiva and like regions,
    are fabricated by stupid imposters.
    
    ... The enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while moksha is death which is cessation of life-breath... the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of moksha.

    A fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings."
    
    — Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha, Verses 8, 9-12</p>

    <p>And the Cyrenaics. While Epicurus was a direct realist, and even the Charvaka were realist, the Cyrenaics were incredibly skeptical, and believed that pleasure was all. They believed all we can know are our senses, but not what they sense. This, obviously, falls into similar self refutation as discussed elsewhere on this site. Nonetheless, they are interesting because of their position, and the fact that they still saw reason in going by social standards, as such things can bring pleasure, and avoid pain. </p>
