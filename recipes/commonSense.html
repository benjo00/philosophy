        <p>Common sense is the normal way our minds and senses function. Without language, for example, if we were to be raised by wolves, common sense is all that would be left. All philosophy is language. Hence, no language, no philosophy. This means that the only valid philosophies are those that do not contradict common sense too much.</p>
        <p>Take a simple example. If you are walking in the forest and see a bear and her cubs, you should, and surely would be quite scared. You might carefully walk away, hoping she doesn't see you. You would then turn your back so you can climb up a small rock face, knowing your car is parked over the hill. Now, we can surely agree that this is the most basic function of the mind and senses: keep you safe, keep track of safety and danger. In this scenario, you knew the bear is dangerous, where she was, and where your escape was. If the skeptics and idealists were correct, then all of this data is faulty. This would mean that your fundamental, basic mind and senses are faulty. This would also mean that any data they build or receive is also faulty, which means that these senses and mind telling you that they have learned that they are faulty cannot be believed, since it would be faulty data. </p>
            
            <p>In a callback to the <a href="./crepes.html">Idealism</a> page, it is also worth mentioning that the exact same problem crops up in physics. If one ostensibly proved that only what is observed at the moment actually exists, that nothing else does when out of mind, that all is dependent on consciousness, or similar, then this would also prove that the fundamental apparatus that built this experiment and position, the mind and senses, are fundamentally, and hopelessly invalid. The mind and senses that tell one, even if one doesn't know language at all, where danger is, where safety is, and so on, like the bear, the hill, and the car in the above example, are the same mind and senses that did, or learned about the experiment. These mind and senses are irretrievably flawed, in this scenario, and, in reality, there was no bear behind you, and no hill to climb, and no car ahead for safety, except when you saw them. Thus, turn your back on the bear, and it cannot kill you, which no sane person would believe. Yet, if this were ostensibly proven true, we have to admit that the mind and senses apparatus is completely discredited, and does not present an even remotely accurate picture of the world. Now, if the fundamental way the mind and senses work is completely false, then how could we possibly believe that this mind and sense apparatus is correct about the experiment? We can't, and would need to conclude that it cannot provide valid data. There is no rational reason to believe that an apparatus that is that faulty can provide reliable data. Thus, the experiment proves that the data is faulty, due to being built by a deeply, completely flawed apparatus that simply doesn't give a true picture of reality. Even though the experiment relies heavily on mathematics, these mathematics are understood with this completely unreliable apparatus. An apparatus that cannot tell the difference between such a simple thing as a bear that exists, and therefore requires fleeing to safety, and one that disappears when you turn around cannot be trusted in its understanding things that are exponentially more complex. And so, the experiment disproves itself. </p>


            <p>As an aside, it is worth mentioning that some critiquing of the mind and senses, of course, is valid. The point isn't that the mind and senses are entirely infallible. The point is that they are for the most part reliable, and even when they don't depict reality exactly as other sensing devices or beings might, it is still built upon reality, and is depicting it with reasonable fidelity. Put differently, we might note that the human eye sees water where there is none, as with the mirage, and thus sometimes the senses mistake falsehood for reality. However, we cannot claim that the human mind and senses see nothing but falsehood, because that would make the statement "the human mind and senses see nothing but falsehood" a falsehood!</p>


            <p>"You cannot prove something to be erroneous with an erroneous proof."
                -Stafford L. Betty
              </p>
                
                <p>With all of that in mind, we are left with two choices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The mind and senses are unimpeachable, at least within reason, and broadly speaking. To undercut them and invalidate them entirely is to collapse the entire scaffolding that any argument seeking to do so would necessarily, and inescapably stand on.</li>
            <li>One must have no position whatsoever, because a person who has faulted the foundations of 100% of their own knowledge cannot have a position that is valid.</li>
        </ol>
<p>Considering the fact that most of us want to have some kind of position on the world, we might decide that the likes of Epicurus, Diogenes, Kumarila Bhatta, or other philosophers who declared the common sense world as real are who we might agree with. That said, of course some may decide they don't care about philosophy, and will go with having no position at all. This is completely valid! The key is to make sure one doesn't slip into becoming a walking embarrassment of self refutation. This happens when one declares they have no philosophy, but then blathers on ad infinitum about what they believe, and why other philosophies are wrong. We cannot have our cake and eat it too in the world of philosophy! If one declares that all is unreal, or that they do not believe anything, then they give up all validity of their own arguments, and must just shrug these things off. </p>
<p>Again, though, this is valid! There was a group in ancient India called the Ajnana. Their position was that they simply didn't know! There is nothing wrong with this. The fault is saying that you know that nothing can be known, that nothing is real, that everything is relative, and similar, because each one of these self refutes. However, stating that you simply don't know is a perfectly safe and rational position. It looks something like this:</p>

<p>"I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that."
    -Digha Nikaya 1
</p>

<p>Anything that challenges common sense also challenges and then defeats itself. Common sense is, by definition, all we have. This is because, while we like to imagine that we have gotten far beyond mere common sense, this common sense is still the foundation for all knowledge. It is inextricably bound to everything that we are and can conceive of. To turn the sword of philosophy on common sense is to turn the sword on one's own position, and kill it.</p>

<p>"If everyday experience poses no threat to you, then you may persist in this denial of the evidence provided by such experience. Quarrel with the evidence of everyday experience, and afterward we will rely on the winner."
    -Chandrakirti, a genius and a giant in the history of Buddhist philosophy
