      <p> Relativism is pretty easy to get through. It is built up on what seems like an insurmountable amount of arguments, to a maddening height. However, the entire philosophy is built missing a linchpin. This pin, this missing knowledge gap, is the fact that if all is relative, then nothing is actually true, including the position that all is relative. It collapsed before you even approached it.</p>

      <p>Put differently: "A common argument against relativism suggests that it inherently refutes itself: the statement "all is relative" classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is absolute, on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative.""

      <p>That said, smaller scale relativism isn't necessarily so flawed. For example, one might say that, like the ancients, the four elements exist, and all things are made from them. Now, from here, we might say that while the elements exist absolutely, everything else is relative, and dependent on each other, and the elements. On the other hand, playing games with smaller scale relativism can still be a problem when it comes to language. For example, the idea that language and meaning, as well as knowledge are strictly relative self refutes, as pointed out in the quote above. Obviously, this is because if all language, meaning and knowledge are relative, then the statement "all language, meaning and knowledge are relative" self refutes. There must be at least some meaning in language, and some knowledge, otherwise the position collapses. See the Wittgenstein quote on the <a src href="./crepes.html">idealism</a> page. In other words, relativism has its uses, but cannot be abused nor overused without falling apart. The safest bet would probably be to stick to very simple ideas of relativism that do not attempt global meaning. Relativism that is too broad is not defensinble.</p>

      <p>Some relativists, like Nagarjuna, have also been classed as nihilists, for refusing to acknowledge that any one thing has meaning, and thus implying, or even stating that things don't exist, which can be interpreted as seeing all as nothingness. Ramanuja had thoughts on this:</p>

      <p>…the Nothing is the only reality.—To this the Sûtra replies, ‘And on account of its being in everyway unproved’—the theory of general Nothingness which you hold cannot stand. Do you hold that everything is being or non-being, or anything else? On none of these views the Nothingness maintained by you can be established. For the terms being and non-being and the ideas expressed by them are generally understood to refer to particular states of actually existing things only. If therefore you declare ‘everything is nothing,’ your declaration isequivalent to the declaration, ‘everything is being,’ for your statement also can only mean that everything that exists is capable of abiding in a certain condition (which you call ‘Nothing’). The absolute Nothingness you have in mind cannot thus be established in any way. Moreover, he who tries to establish the tenet of universal Nothingness can attempt this in so far only as,—through some means of knowledge, he has come to know Nothingness, and he must therefore acknowledge the truth of that means. For if it were not true it would follow that everything is real. The view of general Nothingness is thus altogether incapable of proof.—Here terminates the adhikarana of 'unprovedness in every way.
        -Ramanuja, Vedanta sutra 2.2.28-2.2.31</p>
