  <p>At a glance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Idealism teaches all is mind, and so everything is an illusion, imaginary, and unreal.</li>
    <li>If all is mind, and thus our senses and mind apparatus is unreliable for instinctively believing otherwise, and because unreal things that are purely imaginary are not to be seen as solid, reliable things, it would be absurd to believe that it can know this in the first place, because a faulty mind and senses apparatus built the position. Anyone who truly believed they'd been fooled this severely must become a skeptic, not an idealist. Fool me once that I know what reality is, when it's actually something completely different, shame on you. Fool me twice that I know what reality is, when it's actually something completely different, shame on me! Idealists use the imaginary to prove that the imaginary is imaginary, which is the same as riding a unicorn down the road next to someone riding a pegasus to prove that the pegasus doesn't exist. It is ridiculous. Reductio ad absurdum, then, destroys this position.</li>
    <li>If all is mind, and everything else was a mere illusion, or misapprehension, then it is infinitely more likely that this would be another illusion, and perhaps the truth is that everything is real, then that might be another illusion, and there's another "reality" beneath it, and so on. It's also just as likely that the mind is the illusion, and everything else is real, and that it's all a great trick! Opening the door of "everything you know is wrong and an illusion" welcomes in a vicious infinite regression that is fatal to the argument.</li>
    <li>If all is mind, then all is imaginary, false, and unreal, including the statement "all is mind." Thus, the position self refutes, because the position "all is mind" is false, and unreal. From here, the most logical conclusion is that things are as they seem, in the commonsense way.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Idealism seems like a lot of fun. Nothing is real! It's all in your mind! Neat! But, any rational person can see some serious flaws, here. First, go ahead and try to change something. Seriously, imagine billions of dollars worth of gold coins into your closet. Now, check your closet. Any coins? Try imagining food into your stomach. Did it work? Didn't think so. And of course we could do infinite experiments like that, and not one would work, except some absurdly small things, like quantum level events. But those require interpretation, and are too small to actually see anyway. If you can't actually directly sense it in the first place, and are relying on many levels of inference, you can't make a broad claim that it disproves all commonsense reality, and this type of thing would self refute anyway, as can be seen demonstrated in the <a href="./commonSense.html">Common Sense</a> page. Further, keep in mind that for every interpretation that claims quantum mechanics proves some idealism type idea, there is an interpretation that completely contradicts this notion, and plants physics right back on solid ground. For an example, see Rodney Brooks "Fields of Color." Also, see the below section: "A Note on Science."</p>

    <p>Now, there are many kinds of idealism, but fundamental to all of them is they deny a significant amount of reality to the objective world, or even all of it, and they cast a huge doubt, or entirely refute the senses. None of this works, because if nothing is real, then the position "nothing is real" cannot be real. If your senses and mind are completely unreliable, since they are founded on the commonsense understanding of the world, in which objects exist outside of mind, and that understanding is completely false, then your position falls apart, and you do not have a position at all.</p>

    <p>Wittgenstein put it thusly:
      "We can’t doubt anything without exempting certain other things from doubt. Thus the basic position is that even philosophical doubt requires non-doubt (or belief). That is, in order to get the game of doubt underway, certain things must be placed beyond doubt."
    </p>

    <p>In other words, some things MUST be real, or else you have no position whatsoever. For all intents and purposes, the commonsense world and your mind and senses, being the bare minimum and what all is founded upon, must be real, and providing real, reliable data. If they are not, and all or most of these things are imaginary, then any information built by, or learned by them must also be invalid. Imaginary things cannot demonstrate things to be imaginary, just like a unicorn cannot be brought out as evidence to show that a fairy doesn't exist.</p>

    <p>"You cannot prove something to be erroneous with an erroneous proof." -Stafford L. Betty</p>

   

    <p>While idealists will argue with this, when we really look at it broadly, all idealism falls under a kind of solipsism category (nothing exists but your own mind) if we follow the logic far enough. For example, the Yogacara in some iterations were not solipsist, since they acknowledged other minds, while denying all objective reality. Yet, follow that thought all the way down, and we see, quite quickly, that if a table doesn't exist outside your own mind, and neither does your own body, nor the body of a person you are talking to, then there is no rational reason to believe that the other person's mind exists, either. Thus, deny the commonsense world, and reify the mind, and you fall into solipsism pretty quickly (note: the Pyrrhonists solved this by casting doubt on the mind, too, but they fall into a different trap. See the page on <a href=./simple-spaghetti.html>Extreme Skepticism</a>). Note well, this ends up in the same problem as all idealism: if nothing is real, because all is mind, then the position "nothing is real but the mind" is also imaginary, and unreal.  Further, it has been demonstrated conclusively that solipsism is completely incoherent:</p>

    <p>"The Incoherence of Solipsism</p>

      With the belief in the essential privacy of experience eliminated as false, the last presupposition underlying solipsism is removed and solipsism is shown as foundationless, in theory and in fact. One might even say, solipsism is necessarily foundationless, for to make an appeal to logical rules or empirical evidence the solipsist would implicitly have to affirm the very thing that he purportedly refuses to believe: the reality of intersubjectively valid criteria and a public, extra-mental world. There is a temptation to say that solipsism is a false philosophical theory, but this is not quite strong or accurate enough. As a theory, it is incoherent. What makes it incoherent, above all else, is that the solipsist requires a language (that is, a sign-system) to think or to affirm his solipsistic thoughts at all.
     
      Given this, it is scarcely surprising that those philosophers who accept the Cartesian premises that make solipsism apparently plausible, if not inescapable, have also invariably assumed that language-usage is itself essentially private. The cluster of arguments—generally referred to as “the private language argument”—that we find in the Investigations against this assumption effectively administers the coup de grâce to both Cartesian dualism and solipsism. (I. § 202; 242-315). Language is an irreducibly public form of life that is encountered in specifically social contexts. Each natural language-system contains an indefinitely large number of “language-games,” governed by rules that, though conventional, are not arbitrary personal fiats. The meaning of a word is its (publicly accessible) use in a language. To question, argue, or doubt is to utilize language in a particular way. It is to play a particular kind of public language-game. The proposition “I am the only mind that exists” makes sense only to the extent that it is expressed in a public language, and the existence of such language itself implies the existence of a social context. Such a context exists for the hypothetical last survivor of a nuclear holocaust, but not for the solipsist. A non-linguistic solipsism is unthinkable and a thinkable solipsism is necessarily linguistic. Solipsism therefore presupposes the very thing that it seeks to deny. That solipsistic thoughts are thinkable in the first instance implies the existence of the public, shared, intersubjective world that they purport to call into question."
     
      -Stephen P. Thornton</p>

      <p>"Solipsism is not a falsifiable hypothesis as described by Karl Popper: there does not seem to be an imaginable disproof.[19] According to Popper: a hypothesis that cannot be falsified is not scientific, and a solipsist can observe "the success of sciences" (see also no miracles argument). One critical test is nevertheless to consider the induction from experience that the externally observable world does not seem, at first approach, to be directly manipulable purely by mental energies alone. One can indirectly manipulate the world through the medium of the physical body, but it seems impossible to do so through pure thought (psychokinesis). It might be argued that if the external world were merely a construct of a single consciousness, i.e. the self, it could then follow that the external world should be somehow directly manipulable by that consciousness, and if it is not, then solipsism is false."
        -Wikipedia on Solipsism</p>

        <p>As an aside, it's relevant to point out that some call solipsism the "brain in a vat" argument. This argument is that one could be merely a brain in a vat with electrodes attached projecting the images of a world into it. This is not true solipsism, because there would be a real world, then, and other minds, outside the vat. Regardless, this would still self refute, as everything inside the vat would be false, and part of the illusion, including the statement "This is a brain in a vat." Illusory information cannot be true. It would be absurd to trust illusory information, and it could infinitely be repeated levels of illusion in any case. If the brain can be tricked into thinking that a false world is real, then it might also be tricked into believing that a real world is false, on into infinity. The trick that tells you the truth, which is ostensibly that the world is false, might itself be a trick, and the world is, in actuality, real, and the false world is the trick. It self refutes, collapses under reductio ad absurdum, and vicious infinite regression. So, the argument is invalid.</p>



      <p>"A[n] ... argument against BIV comes from a direction of incoherence, which was presented by the philosopher Hilary Putnam. He attempts to demonstrate this through the usage of a transcendental argument, in which he tries to illustrate that the thought experiment's incoherence lies on the basis that it is self-refuting.[13] To do this, Putnam first established a relationship that he refers to as a "causal connection" which is sometimes referred to as "a causal constraint".[14][2] This relationship is further defined, through a theory of reference that suggested reference can not be assumed, and words are not automatically intrinsically connected with what it represents. This theory of reference would later become known as semantic externalism. This concept is further illustrated when Putnam establishes a scenario in which a monkey types out Hamlet by chance; however, this does not mean that the monkey is referring to the play, because the monkey has no knowledge of Hamlet and therefore can not refer back to it.[15] He then offers the "Twin Earth" example to demonstrate that two identical individuals, one on the Earth and another on a "twin Earth", may possess the exact same mental state and thoughts, yet refer to two different things.[16] For instance, when people think of cats, the referent of their thoughts would be the cats that are found on Earth. However, people's twins on twin Earth, though possessing the same thoughts, would instead be referring not to Earth's cats, but to twin Earth's cats. Bearing this in mind, he writes that a "pure" brain in a vat, i.e., one that has never existed outside of the simulation, could not even truthfully say that it was a brain in a vat. This is because the BIV, when it says "brain" and "vat", can only refer to objects within the simulation, not to things outside the simulation it does not have a relationship with. Putnam refers to this relationship as a "causal connection" which is sometimes referred to as "a causal constraint".[14][2] Therefore, what it says is demonstrably false. Alternatively, if the speaker is not actually a BIV, then the statement is also false. He concludes, then, that the statement "I'm a BIV" is necessarily false and self-refuting."

      <p>"The Disjunctive Argument
        One of the earliest but influential reconstructions of Putnam's transcendental argument was suggested by Anthony L. Brueckner. Brueckner's reconstruction is as follows: "(1) Either I am a BIV (speaking vat-English) or I am a non-BIV (speaking English). (2) If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then my utterances of 'I am a BIV' are true if I have sense impressions as of being a BIV. (3) If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then I do not have sense impressions as of being a BIV. (4) If I am a BIV (speaking vat-English), then my utterances of 'I am a BIV' are false. [(2), (3)] (5) If I am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my utterances of 'I am a BIV' are true if I am a BIV. (6) If I am a non-BIV (speaking English), then my utterances of 'I am a BIV' are false. [(5)] (7) My utterances of 'I am a BIV' are false. [(1), (4), (6)]""

        <p>"The simulation hypothesis itself is based on scientific theories and concepts derived from our experiences of the world. It is predicated, at least in part, on what we take to be empirical scientific knowledge (what brains are and do, what computers are and do, etc.). But if we accept the simulation hypothesis then we acquire a defeater for all of our empirical beliefs and thus for all of our scientific beliefs. Simply put, if the simulation hypothesis is true, we can’t trust the science on which the simulation hypothesis is based, in which case it would be irrational to believe the simulation hypothesis. It looks like the simulation hypothesis has a deeply self-defeating character to it."
          -Anderson</p>

        <!-- **rewrite all of these in your own words** Probably Putnam's own argument against the BIV-scenario, because it aims to show that the BIV-scenario is not just false, but incoherent. Other types of anti-skeptical arguments (Moore's hands, Peirce's paper/tin doubts, or appeals to fallibilism) only seem to help against certain skeptical arguments, but maybe not global nightmare-scenarios like the BIV.

This is copied from two other comments of mine (with some revisions):

Putnam uses the BIV hypothesis to argue that metaphysical realism is incoherent. Metaphysical realism allows for the BIV scenario, but the BIV scenario is incoherent. If we were brains in vats we wouldn't even be able to think that we are brains in vats, unless we have some sort of magical theory of reference, because the BIV-words 'brain' and 'vat' wouldn't refer to brains and vats in the BIV scenario.

If we are brains in vats our words wouldn't have any connection with the world; i.e., our words wouldn't be able to refer ('tree' doesn't refer to trees in the BIV scenario), unless we have some sort of "magical theory" of reference that doesn't require (causal) interaction/connection between words and the world. If our words don't refer, then 'I am a brain in a vat' would not mean the same (or anything?) in BIV-"English" as in ordinary English, and so we can't even formulate BIV skepticism if we're brains in vats.

Another way of putting this is that the BIV-scenario is supposed to be so bad that when you say 'I could be a BIV and so I'm deceived about everything, I'm even deceived about what my word "deceived" or concept of deception refer to or talk about'. That ends up being incoherent, because we then can't even talk about being deceived in virtue of being a BIV, since our word 'deception' doesn't mean deception.

The best discussion I know of Putnam's BIV argument(s) is found in Tim Button's work. Here's the most concise and clear statement that I know of. -->

<!-- If the BIV argument had been completely honest, it would admit that it dissolves itself. If I tell you to accept a certain idea, without showing anything about how the idea could ever be established, we can just defer to the original situation, because nothing has been moved.

It's stepping out of (metaphysical) bounds. -->

      <!-- <p>Yet the brain in vat hypothesis is flawed. -->
<!-- 
        Let us review the argument. It argues that our sensory data is dependent on inputs which can be replicated. This view is not a priori obvious. I mean, we experience the world, and we don't immediately think of neurons firing and electrical impulses. In fact, this view is based on empirical (i.e. Scientific) observations, and hence on experimentation. For these observations and theories to carry weight, the experimental data must be valid.
        
        However, if Scientific theory then implies that our observations are not reliable because they are not necessarily (mostly accurate) representations of the world and we don't know if that data has been falsified that then undermines the empirical data was originally based off. I.e. experiment-based evidence cannot be used to support a thesis which then implies the experiments had no validity. *also, if you are a brain in a vat, then the science that proves that brains in vats are even possible is fake, and thus not to be believed*
        
        Perhaps you are a bran flake, or a coco pop
        This may not be satisfying for the moment. But thinking you are a brain in a vat is incoherent. For now, it remains just as likely you are a coco pop (a yummy chocolate breakfast cereal) or a bran flake (a weird cereal for healthy people) than a brain in a vat.</p> -->

      <p>Have you ever been having some kind of amazing realization, like you suddenly know the meaning of life, and then you realize you are dreaming? Then your head clears a little, and you look at the thing that revealed the truth to you, inside the library of all knowledge, and notice it's a sack of potatoes. You realize that the meaning of life certainly isn't potatoes, and that you only accepted this absurd notion because you are dreaming, and weren't really thinking clearly. You understand that the information you are working with is not real, and thus is very unlikely to be valid. You realize that you have learned nothing, despite the theme of the dream being great knowledge. Since none of what you're experiencing is real, the ridiculous notion about potatoes can't be real, either, despite all other evidence in the dream pointing to potatoes as the answer. Even if you'd spent hours demonstrating, and proving that potatoes are the answer, you know that all of your demonstrations and evidence isn't real, so your conclusions aren't either. The meaning of life is not potatoes. The unreal cannot demonstrate another unreal thing to be true. Yet, the idealists claim that they discover that life is a dream, and inexplicably declare that they know more than they did before. In reality, they would know infinitely less, that is, if they could possibly be correct. They cannot claim to have discovered that all knowledge is false, and then stand on that as if they've taught people some kind of truth, because, as above, if all knowledge is false, then their idealist position is also false. Back to our analogy, imagine you woke up, groggy, half-asleep, and start telling someone about this truth, but then realize how absurd it is. You'd laugh, and explain that it was a silly dream.</p>
   
    <p>"Are potatoes the meaning of life? Maybe! What a funny idea!" This would be the proper mood of response for the idealist who just considered that life may be a dream: cheerful suspension of judgement. This is because the position is absurd. A firmly confident idealist is a very, very confused person, as confused as you would be if you went on a tour trying to convince people that the meaning of life is potatoes! Both of you would understand that you've gotten your information from the unreal, and imaginary. Trying to convince people that your imaginary, unreal knowledge is real is laughable, and embarrassing. While there is nothing wrong with saying "Maybe none of this is real, who knows?" there is something deeply flawed about saying "I know that none of this is real, and here is my proof!" It's as profoundly stupid and redundant as trying to convince other imaginary characters in a dream that they are in a dream. Worse, it's like being wide awake, closing your eyes, and conjuring up a person in your own imagination and trying to demonstrate to them that they are in your imagination, and spending hours trying to convince them. Even worse if you spent years, or your entire life trying to convince them, and even wrote papers, or books trying to do so! Such an undertaking belongs in the dictionary as an example for the word "asinine." Wasting years of your life, and countless pages of text on trying to convince the imaginary that it is imaginary is gratingly stupid. This is precisely the life's work of an idealist.</p>

    <p>An amusing result of my harsh treatment of the idealist position is that many idealists have gotten angry with me. They get offended, they argue with me, try to convince me I'm wrong, and idealism is correct, and so on. Does this not simply prove my point? They obviously don't really believe that all is mind. If they did, then they would have no problem with my arguments. They also wouldn't go to work, pay their bills, nor do anything but fly around, time travel, go to other fun, magical realms, make their bodies grow to a thousand feet tall, and otherwise enjoy the powers of the imagination! Quite the opposite is the actual case, though. The idealist goes to work every day, pays their bills, and argues with realists, trying to convince them that their realist positions are imaginary, and they try to prove it with their own admittedly imaginary positions. The idealist follows all of the rules that the realist claims are real. They look both ways before crossing the street and generally avoid danger (as we all should!), they go grocery shopping, wash their dishes, bathe, buy clothing, and so on. The idealist lives as if realism is correct at all times, while only verbally claiming that they believe in idealism. They come up with ridiculous excuses for why they do these things, and build bizarre, nonsensical philosophies that ostensibly make it all make sense. They say everything is imaginary, and explain that, despite this, due to some intricate nuance in their philosophy, they absolutely must see their accountant on Thursday to get their taxes in before tax day! See why I said idealists are confused?</p>


      <p>Des Cartes made the famous statement "I think, therefore I am." This ostensibly props up and reifies the mind, while casting doubt on the senses, and their data. Yet, we have the exact same amount of information to confirm the mind as we do the sense data. We perceive a thought, and if merely perceiving a thought affirms the reality of the mind, then perceiving an object surely confirms the reality of the object. This is likely why the Buddhists categorized the mind as one of the senses. Thus, a fuller, more accurate thought on the matter should be "I think, therefore the perceived thought of "I" is, and I see, hear, taste, smell, and touch things, therefore those things perceived, also, are." Hence, the Cartesian position, fully, and properly extrapolated, must confirm commonsense reality, and casts no doubt whatsoever. This is because if we must say that the mind is a given because it is present, then we must say the senses, and their objects are, too. However, if we must say that the senses and their objects are in doubt, then so is the mind, and its objects. Both could be some kind of illusion. Both mind and senses are real in the commonsense, everyday world, and neither stand up to rigorous philosophizing and extreme skepticism. We can argue that the mind is some kind of an illusion just as easily as we could argue the same about the senses. It is just as likely that the sense objects are real, and the mind is some kind of misperception to be exposed by a science experiment, or the mind is just a spell cast by a wizard, as it is that the mind is real, and the senses and their objects are the illusion. One absurd conclusion opens the door for another. Repeat ad infinitum, ad absurdum.</p>

     

      <p>"The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of attaining ataraxia (becoming tranquil). Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would attain ataraxia. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs".

        — Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 12</p>

        <p>"If form does not exist, then do not cling to the existence of mind; and if mind exists, then do not cling to the nonexistence of form.

          When, for some reason, one does not admit the existence of form, then the existence of both is equally unreasonable and one must admit the nonexistence of mind, as well. And when one admits the existence of mind, then it is necessary to admit the existence of form, for both are conventionally real."
        -Chandrakirti, The Emptiness of Emptiness, translated by C.W. Huntington</p>

        <p>In other words, if you say the mind is real, and we've all been fooled, inexplicably, that the senses and their objects are real, when in reality they are illusions, I can just as easily say the opposite is true, as I demonstrated above, with just as sound reasoning. This is precisely why all of this stuff self refutes: there is no end to the attack, and there is no reason to think one position which destroys all of commonsense reality is safe from the same assault. All positions function only if commonsense reality is intact.</p>
       
        <p>Further, if one of these ridiculous conclusions were supposedly true, then others are infinitely more likely to be true. For example, if things are roughly as they seem, there is no reason to assume otherwise. Yet, if almost everything we know is some kind of illusion, and we learn that there is a different actual reality beneath it, then it becomes infinitely more likely that this new true reality is just another illusion on top of the really real reality. It would also be just as likely that the original reality was the real one, and the new, ostensible true reality is the illusion, and we've been fooled into thinking otherwise. Lather, rinse, repeat ad infinitum. </p>



<p>Idealism is not a valid position.</p>

    <p>Sure, some will infinitely eel wriggle around and try to argue versions of quasi idealism that are somehow ostensibly valid, despite these fatal flaws. But, if they are so light on idealism as to allow commonsense reality to stand, then they are not really idealism. If they are too far over the line so as to contradict commonsense reality, then they are invalid. there is no grey area. Some will even vehemently, and bizarrely, argue that even Yogacara is not idealism at all! Rather than even address this ridiculous claim, I'll just direct you to the quotes from the founders of Yogacara, as well as scholars on the topic in the section below, titled "Compare Yogacara." Suffice it to say, the "mind only" school of philosophy is idealism, by any rational person's definition. The only people who could possibly argue otherwise clearly have some kind of bias in their position.</p>

    <p>For a thorough example of how and why the commonsense world can never be entirely refuted in a valid philosophy, and what the alternatives are, please see the <a href=./commonSense.html>Common Sense</a> page.</p>

    <!-- <p>A point that is always brought up is that if the commonsense world is a given, then what of hallucinations? Must they be real, too, then? This falls apart for the same reason idealism does: the word "hallucination" is meaningless unless the commonsense world is intact. It assumes that there is a real world to contrast against a false hallucination. Thus, an idealist who claims all is mind cannot use hallucinations as a weapon against the commonsense world, because they have collapsed the scaffolding of language needed to make the argument.</p> -->

    

<p>In a very strange twist of fate, this position was articulated brilliantly by a relativist philosopher named "Tsong Khapa" over five hundred years ago, thusly:

  "[l]f there were no place for conventional phenomena, the existence of which is established by the epistemic instruments, these phenomena would be like the snake - that is,
  the rope grasped as a snake - of which no cause or effect is possible. . . .
  [l]f one were forced to maintain that there is no place for bondage, liberation, etc in the
  meaning of “conventional existence/’ and that these must be placed only in the erroneous perspective, that would be a great philosophical error.
  Even worse, as long as convention is conceived [as entirely nonexistent], since there
  would be no role for the epistemic instruments, neither the proposition maintained nor
  the person who maintains it nor the proof - including scriptural sources and reasoning - could be established by epistemic instruments. So it would be ridiculous to maintain
  that there are no genuine phenomena delivered by the epistemic instruments.” {Ocean
  30-31 )15
 
  Tsong khapa makes it plain here that conventional phenomena, unlike the snake
  thought to be perceived when one sees a rope, have causes and effects, and are
  actual. Moreover, he argues that the repudiation of the reality of the conventional
  would undermine the possibility of epistemic authority, undermining even the abil-
  ity to argue cogently that the conventional does not exist. Such a position would
  be self-refuting."
  -Jay Garfield, Taking Conventional Truth Seriously"
</p>

<p>Another excellent argument was made by the Sautrantika, and is here elucidated:</p>

<p>"The Yogacara argues that though the object is identical with its cognition and is nothing but a mode of consciousness, yet it is illusorily presented as distinct from, and external to, the cognition. The object whichis a mere form of cognition (jfJanasvarupa) appears to us as if it were an external entity owing to an illusion. The duality of subject (grahaka) and object (grahya) is an illusory appearance. Cognition alone is real. What is really an internal cognition appears to be an external object.

  The Sautrantika urges that if there are no external objects at all, we can never assert that internal cognitions appear to be external objects. The illusory appearance of externality presupposes the real knowledge of externality somewhere. If we were completely ignorant of the external world, we could never speak of the illusory appearance of externality. No sensible person would say : “ Vasubandhu looks like the son of a barren mother.’ * The sense of objectivity can never be derived from mere modes of consciousness."</p>
  <p>"...The Sautrantika advances the following formal argument to prove the existence of external objects. Those things which appear at times, while another thing is uniformly present, must depend upon something else. The series of self-cognitions (alayavijnana) is uniformly present. But object-cognitions (pravrttivijflana) appear occasionally. Therefore they must depend on something other than the series of self-cognitions. They are caused by external objects which are independent of all cognitions.... The Yogacara holds that the occasional appearance of object-cognitions (pravrttivijnana) is not due to external objects, but to the maturation of subconscious impressions (vasanaparipaka) within the stream of consciousness itself. The variety of object-cognitions or sensations is due to the variety of subconscious impressions (vasana) which appear and disappear in a beginningless series of nescience. (Dbject-cognitions break in upon the field of consciousness owing to the revival of subconscious impressions in the same psychic continuum. They are not imposed from without but are evolved from within. Subconscious impressions are awakened by those antecedent mental states with which they were associated in the past, and are raised to the level of consciousness. The revival of subconscious impressions is responsible for the emergence of object-cognitions or sensations. They cannot be traced to external objects. Sensations are not “ given They are creations of the mind. The Yogacara advocates unadulterated subjectivism or mentalism.

    But the Sautrantika contends that if all subconscious impressions have a tendency to rise above the threshold of consciousness, why they should remain at all in the subconscious level as latent predispositions is unintelligible. Then, again, why a particular antecendent mental state awakens a subconscious impression and brings it to the level of consciousness is a mystery. It may be awakened by all the antecedent mental states in the same psychic continuum, because they all equally belong to the same continuum. If all the antecedent mental states cannot awaken a subconscious impression, a single antecedent mental state cannot awaken it either. Then, again, it is absurd to suppose that all previous mental states awaken a subconscious impression, and modify a particular psychosis. Thus subconscious impressions can never account for object-cognitions or sensations. Hence the Sautrantika concludes that we must admit the reality of external objects capable of exciting the sensations of sound, touch, colour, taste, smell, and feelings of pleasure and pain occasionally."

    <p>"Mallisena's Criticism of the Togacara Idealism</p>

      <p>(1) Cognition is an act (kriya). It is an act of knowing an object. It must have an object. The act of cognition is directed to an object. It is an act by which an object is known. An objectless cognition is impossible.* An illusion is not absolutely objectless. The illusory perception of hairs in the sky presupposes perception of real hairs at some other time and place. Dreams also are recollections of objects actually perceived in the past. Neither illusions nor dreams are absolutely objectless.* The object which is apprehended by a cognition is external. The cognition of externality cannot be said to be illusory, since an illusion consists in the apprehension of an object actually perceived in the past and attributed to another object perceived at present owing to defects of the sense-organs and the like. An illusion presupposes perception of an external object at some other time and place. It is not without a substratum in external objects. Therefore it cannot disprove the existence of external objects.*
      
      (2) An external object has practical efficiency ; it produces effects and fulfils our needs. So the cognition of an external object cannot be said to be illusory. If it is supposed to be illusory in spite of its practical efficiency, the distinction between valid perception and illusory perception will be abolished, and the satisfaction of a person eating real sweetmeat will be the same as that of a person who dreams of eating sweetmeat. But real sweetmeat is never the same as imaginary sweetmeat. There is a distinction between real things and imaginary things. Real things serve our practical purposes. But imaginary things have absolutely no practical use. Therefore the existence of external objects is proved by their pragmatic value. ... the difference between the object and its cognition is distinctly perceived. Perception proves their difference. Inference cannot disprove it. The evidence of inference is of no value against the evidence of perception. Perception decides the issue when there is a conflict between perception and inference. ... Everybody perceives an external object. The universal experience of mankind bears testimony to its existence. To deny the reality of external objects is to fly in the face of it.
      -ibid. p 65-66
      
      </p>

      <p>The Samkhya have some problems with idealism, too:</p>

      <p>"Aniruddha sets forth the following arguments against subjective idealism ; —

        Firstly, the world is not made up of mere ideas because, if it were so, an external object, e.g. a jar, would be perceived as I am a jar ”, and not as “ this is a jar ”. But, as a matter of fact, an external object is always perceived as “ this ” and not as “ I ”. It is perceived as of the nature of not-self as distinguished from the self.^ The self and the not-self are diametrically opposed to each other.
        
        Secondly, the difference in the perceptions of objects cannot be due to the distinctive peculiarities of the subconscious impressions (vasanaviSesa) ; for if there is no external reality at all, there can be no subconscious impressions of jars and the like, and so there can be no such distinctive peculiarities in subconscious impressions.® Then, again, we may ask what is the cause of the socalled subconscious impression (vasana). It is either another subconscious impression or an impression left by a previous perception of something external (bahyavasana). If the former, there will be no determining condition of the perception of different objects, and there will be perception of everything at all times. If the latter, there does exist something other than cognitions, and this very object is an external reality."
      -ibid p 77-78</p>

        <p>As does the very well known Yoga school of Patanjali:</p>

        <p>...The external reality is presented to consciousness as "this" by its own presentative power. It is the given. It is an object of perception which is valid. The Yogacaras deny the reality of the external world on the strength of imagination which is invalid. Imagination cannot override the authority of perception.^ The external object is real and independent of cognition ; it is presented to the cognition by its own power The Yogacaras first suppose that external objects are presented to consciousness because they are mere construction of imagination ; then they deny the reality of the external world on the strength of such an imaginary hypothesis. So they cannot be trusted. Vijnianabhiksu explains Vyasa’s criticism thus: All perceptible objects are presented to consciousness through their intercourse with the sense-organs by their own power. They are perceived by their own power of perceptibility. They are objects of direct perception. They cannot be likened to objects of dream-cognitions which owe their existence to some disorders of the body or the mind. The objects of perception are not contradicted like those of dream-cognitions. So the existence of external objects apprehended by valid perception can never be denied on the strength of invalid dream-cognitions. The Yogacaras who deny the reality of the external world cannot be trusted, since, on their own hypothesis, their ideas have no counterparts in reality, and their words are not expressions of true ideas and do not denote real objects. Thus by denying the reality of the external world the Yogacaras deny the truth of their own statements."

        <p>"May Sinclair states the position of the realist thus : “ No act of mere knowing, even if it were absolute — ^and knowing is purely relative to the known and the knower — no act of knowing could confer reality upon its object. Things are not there because we know them ; we know them because they are there.” ® “ In no sense are things there because we perceive them ; we perceive them because they are there and they owe nothing to our perceiving.” * Thus an object is known by an act of cognition, not because it is identical with the cognition, but is different from it.

          (2) Vacaspati argues that knowability (vedyatva) of an object by an act of cognition is not pervaded by identity between the object and the cognition, and therefore it cannot negate the difference between them. An object is not known by a cognition because it is identical with the cognition. Therefore its knowability cannot disprove its difference from the cognition. In fact, knowledge of an object by a cognition presupposes a difference between them.®
          
          May Sinclair states the realist’s position thus : “ If a thing is known, ipso facto it is something more than the act, or state of knowing. Idealism assumes that this act or state is simpler than it really is. Knowing involves at least two terms and a relation, whether you take the subject and object as your terms and consciousness as your relation, or consciousness and the object of consciousness, when your relation will be an unknown x. In either case the object will stand on its own feet as a separate and independent entity, which is all that realism wants.” ^ “ According to realists, the process of

          knowledge always implies that the mind is confronted with an object, and always implies that we are never under any conceivable circumstances identical with that object. Even when we apprehend our own experiences, the process of apprehension cannot be identical with the experience which is apprehended.” ^ Therefore the cognitive relation is not the same as identity.
          
          Vacaspati points out that the reasons advanced by the Yogacara for the denial of external reality, viz. knowability (vedyatva) and invariably simultaneous perception (sahopalambha) are not conclusive, since the application of the method of difference here is doubtful, or rather impossible."
        -ibid p 85-86</p>

        <p>"...both the arguments of the Yogacara are fallacious. Neither knowability of the object (vedyatva) nor invariably simultaneous perception of the object and the act of knowledge (sahopalambha) can prove the identity of the object with its cognition.

          (4) Further, the power of perception cannot be done away with by mere imagination. The certainty of perception which gives us a direct and immediate knowledge of external objects can never be rejected on the strength of imagination or logical abstraction.
          
          (5) Further, externality (bahyatva) and extension (sthulatva), the attributes of the material objects and phenomena which are apprehended by cognitions, can never exist in them. ... Further, Patanjali says : “ Though the object remains the same, the ideas about it may be different. So their ways of being are different. ’’ 

          Vyasa explains the above argument thus : One and the same object is common to many minds. It is not the “ private property ” of any individual mind. It is the “ public property ” of all minds. It is the common object ofobservation of all minds ; it is equally accessible to them all. So it cannot be regarded as creation of imagination. It is neither imagined by one mind nor imagined by many minds. But it exists in itself and for itself independently of all minds. The object has extra-mental existence. It is not the subjective creation of fancy Even though the object remains the same it excites different feelings in different persons. It excites the feeling of pleasure on account of merit (dharma). It excites the feeling of pain on account of demerit (adharma). It excites the feeling of delusion on account of nescience (avidya). It excites the feeling of indifference on account of right knowledge (samyak dar^ana). Since one and the same object excites different feelings in different persons, it cannot be regarded as creation of anybody’s imagination because one’s imaginary ideas cannot produce similar ideas in other minds. Thus the object exists in itself independent of all minds. The object and its cognition are different from each other ; the object is apprehended (grahya) and the cognition is the apprehending mental mode (grahana) ; both of them are real and existent and can never be confused with each other. Similarly Vijfianabhiksu says that both the object and the mind are said to be self-existent (svatantra), since they are independent of each other.

          Vacaspati argues that of two things, if one remains the same and the other differs, they must be absolutely different from each other. The same object is perceived by Caitra, Devadatta, Visnumitra and Maitra. Here though the object remains the same, the ideas of different persons differ from one another. So the object must be different from ideas.^ The identity of the object is ascertained by different persons perceiving it by comparing notes, though their ideas of the same object differ from each other. "
        -ibid p 89-90</p>

        <p>"Bhojadeva argues that the object cannot be a creation of the mind, since the same object excites different feelings in different minds. If the object were the creation of an individual mind, it would appear to consciousness as uniform, and it would cease to exist when that mind would attend to some other object, and it would never be perceived by any other mind. But, as a matter of fact, an object is observed by many minds, and so it cannot be regarded as the product of an individual mind. If it were created by many minds at the same time, it would differ from the creation of an individual mind."

<p>"The Yoga Criticism of a Type of Buddhist Realism

  Some Buddhists hold that the objects are real and external to minds, but they come into existence along with our cognitions, since they are experienced like pleasure and pain.^ They are not subjective idealists. The external objects, according to them, have no existence either in the past or in the future, but have only a momentary existence in the present moment. They come into existence when we perceive them, and they cease to exist when we cease to perceive them. Dr. Das Gupta puts it thus : “ The moment I have an idea of a thing, the thing rises into existence and may be said to exist only for that moment and as soon as the idea disappears the object also vanishes, for when it cannot be presented to me in the form of ideas it can be said to exist in no sense.” ^

  Vacaspati explains the above Buddhist position thus : Let the object be different from its cognition. Still the object being unintelligent cannot be apprehended without a cognition. It is manifested by a cognition. So it cannot be said to exist at a time when it is not the object of immediate knowledge.®
  
  Vyasa urges that this conception of an object coming into existence with a cognition contradicts the fact that the object is common to all persons, and thus denies the existence of the object in the past and in the future.^
  
  Vacaspati says that an object is certainly common to all minds. It continues to be apprehended by persons for a succession of many moments though it is changing in its nature.® This clearly shows that it does not come into being along with its apprehending cognition. If the object comes into being with a cognition, its appearance and disappearance must depend upon cognitions. But this is not the case. Further, if an object owed its existence to a cognition, it would never be presented to consciousness as “ this ” (idam). But, as a matter of fact, an object is always perceived as “ this ” ; and it cannot, therefore, owe its existence to a cognition.^

  Patanjali says : “ An object does not depend on a particular mind ; for what will happen to it when it is not apprehended by that mind ? ”  Vyasa explains the aphorism thus : If the object depends on a particular mind, what will be the fate of the object when that mind will attend to some other object, or restrain all its functions, since at that time it will neither be apprehended by that mind nor by any other mind. So it will cease to exist at that time. And if it thus ceases to exist, how can it again come into existence when the attention of the individual is again directed towards it * Further, all parts of an object are not apprehended by the mind at the same time. So those parts which are not apprehended would not exist. Thus when the front side of an object is apprehended, its back side which is not apprehended at the time cannot be said to exist. And if the back side does not exist, the front side also may as well be said not to exist because they are held to be coexistent with each other. Thus the whole object would be regarded as nonexistent. Hence Vyasa concludes that the external reality is independent of all minds, and is the common object of observation of all persons; there are different minds in different persons ; and all the experiences of the self arise from the relation of the mind with the external world."
-ibid p 95-96</p>

<p>A Note on Science:</p>

<p>One might note that if the above criticized type of perception was true, our cars wouldn't work, because we only observe the front while driving, and so the rear tires would cease to exist! In fact, all the tires would cease to exist, as would the outside of the car! Ditto for everything else. Almost nothing would work, from science experiments to cooking dinner. Further, the scientist doing experiments on things that cannot be seen with the naked eye would be doing no experiment at all! There would be nothing in the space that they cannot see. Since quantum particles, like electrons, cannot be seen by the naked eye, nor by even a magnified scope of any kind, this would mean not a single quantum experiment has ever been carried out. On the other hand, if interacting with the experiment indirectly, while not directly conscious of the particles, using inanimate instruments, and inferring that particles are doing whatever they are doing, is enough to determine that the particles are actually there, then this would mean that everything is interacting with everything, and thus that everything exists, regardless of whether or not anyone is aware of it. If the particle I cannot see is around to interact with things, even though I'm not directly aware of it, because it is interacting with inanimate matter, then all inanimate matter, everywhere, should keep all other inanimate matter in place, as well. Hence, the idea that any quantum experiment has proven that reality doesn't exist when we are not aware of it self refutes, because we are not directly aware of quantum particles, and so if they don't exist when we are not directly aware of them, then the experiment never happened. </p>

<p>This is actually known as decoherence, and is a well known fact. Yet, many flock to the interpretations of physics experiments seen in click bait headlines, and shout "Science has proven objective reality doesn't exist!" without realizing this is a self refuting statement. In reality, a single quantum when isolated from all the outside world goes into a wave state. Once it is observed again, it collapses back into a particle. This "observation" cannot be done by a human mind, such is impossible, because we have no way to image them. The "observer" is an inanimate instrument. The rest of the world and all of its quantum particles stay in their particle state because they are always "observed" by all kinds of macroscopic objects. Really, someone seriously dropped the ball when they decided to call "interacting with a quantum particle" "observing" because this has lead to countless people thinking that consciousness is what collapses quantum particles. In reality, we are NEVER conscious of quantum particles directly, because we cannot see them, nor detect them in any way whatsoever without inanimate objects, which, themselves, must exist to do the experiment in the first place, and so on, as above. So, while people write books called "The Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness," we need to remember that, no, physics did not encounter consciousness at the quantum level, because consciousness of the quantum level of reality is compltely impossible, and can only be inferred from results from the inanimate, non conscious world. For a much better explanation of the quantum world, see Rodney Brooks's "Fields of Color," as recommended above. For some more, and some amusing responses to this type of alarmist, asinine interpretation of quantum  mechanics, see below: </p>

<p>"Quantum mechanics (QM) is supposed to be a universal theory: its domain of applicability is not restricted to the world at very small length scales. In other words, the theory is meant to describe elephants as well as electrons. While we do not, of course, need to use quantum theory to describe elephants, there are increasingly larger and more complex laboratory systems (i.e., tabletop experiments) being built that do display quantum behaviour. There are various proposals for why, in practice, we do not need to use quantum theory to describe the world at the length- and time-scales that are familiar to us as human beings. The central of these is decoherence—the idea that the interference effects that would otherwise reveal our ‘quantum-ness’ get suppressed when a system interacts with other systems around it (‘the environment’). Thus, demonstrating the quantum behaviour of a laboratory system requires the system to be isolated (to a great degree) from outside influences."
  -Karen Crowther
</p>

<p>"Of course there is not a new experiment that suggests there’s no such thing as objective reality. That would be silly. (What would we be experimenting on?)

  There is a long tradition in science journalism—and one must admit that the scientists themselves are fully culpable in keeping the tradition alive—of reporting on experiments that (1) verify exactly the predictions of quantum mechanics as they have been understood for decades, and (2) are nevertheless used to claim that a wholesale reimagining of our view of reality is called for. This weird situation comes about because neither journalists nor professional physicists have been taught, nor have they thought deeply about, the foundations of quantum mechanics. We therefore get situations like the present one, where an intrinsically interesting and impressive example of experimental virtuosity is saddled with a woefully misleading sales pitch. ...
  
  In the experiment being discussed, branching did not occur. Rather than having an actual human friend who observes the photon polarization—which would inevitably lead to decoherence and branching, because humans are gigantic macroscopic objects who can’t help but interact with the environment around them—the “observer” in this case is just a single photon. "
  -Reality Remains Intact, by Sean Carroll

<p>"A group of physicists claims to have found experimental evidence that there are no objective facts observed in quantum experiments. For some reason, they have still chosen to share the observations from their quantum experiment with the outside world."
  -Dustin Lazarovici
</p>

<p>"
  The MIT Technology Review article that occasions this discussion has the rather astounding title “A quantum experiment suggests there’s no such thing as objective reality”. One could be rightly puzzled about how any experiment could suggest any such thing, since the existence of “objective reality” seems to be a pre-condition for the existence of experiments in the first place.
  
  The abstract is perhaps slightly more promising: “Physicists have long suspected that quantum mechanics allows two observers to experience different, conflicting realities. Now they’ve performed the first experiment that proves it.” After all, familiar optical illusions permit different observers to “experience different, conflicting realities” in the sense of conflicting apparent realities. Of course, in such a case at least one of the “perceived realities” is indeed illusory, since they cannot both be veridical and also conflicting on pain of violating the Law of Non-Contradiction.
  
  But further perusal of the article dashes any hope of anything comprehensible in this way. The experiments in question are done on a system composed of only six photons. Obviously the photons do not experience anything at all, much less conflicting realities. What in the world is going on?
  
  In short, the way that this experiment is described—in terms of its significance—is complete nonsense. Physicists have become accustomed to spouting nonsense when quantum mechanics is the subject of discussion, which often takes the form of mind-blowing assertions about the loss of “classical reality” or even “classical logic”. The reason we know that all of this is nonsense right off the bat is that the experimental predictions of standard quantum mechanics can be accounted for—in several different ways—by theories that postulate an objective, unique physical reality governed by definite laws and using only classical logic and mathematics. So when the sorts of claims made in the title and abstract of the article are made, one knows immediately that they are unjustified hype. ... Suppose, in other words, one were dead-set on maintaining that the physical world is local in the face of all the experimental evidence that it isn’t. How might that be done?

  It seems rather desperate but I suppose one might go so far as denying the very existence of any objective physical reality at all. Or, as I sometimes put it, “Nothing really exists, but thank God it is local”. But as should be obvious, this accomplishes nothing. If there is no objective physical world then there is no subject matter for physics, and no resources to account for the outcomes of experiments.
  
  There are many good books that correctly and clearly exposit the situation, including David Albert’s Quantum Mechanics and Experience, Travis Norson’s Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Peter Lewis’s Quantum Ontology, Jean Bricmont’s Understanding Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Sense and Nonsense, and (co-incidentally) my own Philosophy of Physics Quantum Theory which happens to go on sale on March 19.

<p>"
  Headline news! Stop the presses! A group of experimenters did an experiment, and the results came out exactly the way that our best physical theory of such things says it should, just as everyone expected. Quantum Theory Confirmed Again.
  
  That’s what actually happened, though you’d never know it from the clickbait headline: A quantum experiment suggests there’s no such thing as objective reality [1].
  
  The experiment [2] was inspired by a recent paper by Časlav Brukner, entitled “A No-Go Theorem for Observer-Independent Facts” [3]. The abstract of the paper reporting on the experiment proclaims, “This result lends considerable strength to interpretations of quantum theory already set in an observer-dependent framework and demands for revision of those which are not.”
  
  Here’s a nice fact about claims of this sort: when you see one, you can be sure, without even going through the details of the argument, that any conclusion to the effect that the predictions of quantum mechanics are incompatible with an objective, observer-independent reality, is simply and plainly false. That is because we have a theory that yields all of the predictions of standard quantum mechanics and coherently describes a single, observer-independent world. This is the theory that was presented already in 1927 by Louis de Broglie, and was rediscovered in 1952 by David Bohm, and is either called the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory, or Bohmian mechanics, depending on who you’re talking to. You can be confident that, if you went through the details of any real or imagined experiment, then you would find that the de Broglie-Bohm theory gives a consistent, observer-independent, one-world account of what happens in the experiment, an account that is in complete accord with standard quantum mechanics with regards to predictions of experimental outcomes."
-Quantum Theory Confirmed Again
by Wayne Myrvold</p>



<p>An interesting critique about ideas of time from the Yoga school:</p>

<p>"The Reality of the Past and the Future</p>

  <p>Vyasa criticizes another doctrine of the Buddhist that neither the past nor the future exists but only the momentary present. He says ; “ The future is the manifestation which is to be. The past is the manifestation which has been experienced. The present is that which is in active operation. It is this three-fold substance which is the object of knowledge. If it did not exist in reality, there would not exist the knowledge of it. How could there be knowledge in the absence of anything that might be known ? For this reason the past and the future exist in reality.” 
  
  Vacaspati argues that knowledge manifests an object to consciousness. It cannot exist in the absence of the object. The yogin has knowledge of the past, the present, and the future at a single glance of intuition. Men, like ourselves also, have knowledge of the past in recollection, of the present in perception, and of the future in expectation and inference. But neither our knowledge nor that of the yogin can be produced in the absence of the corresponding object. But such knowledge is produced. For this reason, the knowledge of a person who feels that the past and the future exist along with the present in a general way, is said to be a reason for the existence of the object itself. Thus the past and the future exist as much as the present. The present is patent. The past is latent. And the future is sublatent. The past and the future exist in the present."
-ibid. p 97</p>



<p>Imagine someone handed you a photo, and asked what it was. It turns out to be distorted, and strange looking. So, you go around, ask others, compare it to pictures on the internet, examine the camera that took it, and so on. You find that the camera is damaged, and why the photo turned out the way it did. After a lot of research, you figure out what the picture actually is! Many people think this is how it would be with the senses. However for the senses, a better comparison would be if a portal to another universe opened up that we no NOTHING about. You toss a camera through on a string, take some pictures, and pull it back to our universe. The portal closes, never to open again. The pictures have strange images, and something resembling a rainbow in several. Then, sadly, you learn that the camera is defective. The rainbows are due to errors, and the images might actually have come from the camera, rather than the other universe. Well, now what? You CANNOT go through the same process as above, because there is no one else to ask, there are no pictures on the internet to compare it with, and so on. This camera is the ONLY information you have on this other universe, and you discovered it is defective. Thus, you can't build any kind of idea of what the other universe is like. You cannot use other tools and devices to analyze the camera or its photos to learn more, because all you know is that you have a broken camera, and you know NOTHING about the other universe. </p>

<p>This is how it would be if you declared your own mind and senses defective. They are ALL YOU KNOW of our universe. If they are defective, you know nothing about it. It doesn't matter what tools or devices you use, if you demonstrate that your senses are not reliable, then you couldn't believe that they are interpreting the data from your tools and devices correctly in the first place! The alternate idea that idealists have comes from mysticism. They implicitly or explicitly assume that there is a magical ghost inside the human mind, and that it can see the "real world" in some way. This ghost must be able to step aside from the mind and senses, and see reality for what it really is. For the Yogacara, they believed magic meditative states allowed this, and other religions believed god allowed this for them, and so on. In reality, there is no such thing (I'm agnostic on the issue of god for the purposes of this article, and am making no statements about such an entity's existence, but we might agree there is no evidence for this type of ability being bequeathed onto people regarding consciousness). If there were, we'd all be able to do it, and all agree on these things.</p>

<p>While we're on cameras, it's worth noting that a lot of older arguments for idealism relied on the conceptual fog surrounding objective reality absent technology to demonstrate its true, mind-independent objectivity. For example, George Berkeley posited that since blue never exists outside of the perception of blue, then all is imaginary. But, today, we can analyze blue, and show that it exists when unobserved. We can video tape it, we can split light with a prism and isolate the blue, we can even show what chemicals make up "blue" in the first place, and so on.</p>


<p>Another issue people lean on is how humans perceive things. For example, they will say "Rainbows don't really exist, they are only in your mind, because colors aren't real." This implies they are like hallucinations, and, ostensibly, invalidates the senses to some degree. This is nonsense. Let's make it simpler: imagine a piece of light sensitive paper. It turns black when light hits it. Do we say, "Because it turned black, and didn't depict a perfect image of the world, the paper is only hallucinating, and the black is in its mind." No, because that would be insane. When a tiny organism that can only see light or dark, responds to light, do we say, "The being is only imagining that the world is just light and dark, so it is hallucinating a version of the world that doesn't exist." No, again, because that would be ridiculous. We note that the light changed the color because that's how light affects the paper, and that the organism responded to the light, because that's how light affects the organism. Only if the paper didn't turn black, or the organism didn't respond to the light would we say it was defective. This is because light is actually affecting them, regardless of how they respond, or how it might seem to them. Likewise, light really does split when it goes through a prism, like the rainbow. The way it affects the human eye and brain is to make colors. A real thing affects another real thing. There is no logical way to say "colors aren't real," nor "rainbows don't exist," nor anything of the sort. Further, cameras can see rainbows, too, and a lot of other things that the eye can see! If our brains were creating some kind of unreal world that didn't at all match reality, this would not be the case. Regardless, though, only hallucinations are unreal. Everything else, even optical illusions, like mirages, are, in a sense, real, because they are caused by real things, and affect real things. </p>

<p>The assumption that the human mind and senses must see things in some other way than they do somehow is, again, as above, based on mysticism, and the assumption that one could somehow step out of one's own mind and senses, and that we are some kind of ghosts watching a tv screen inside our heads. The ghost sees a movie played for it by the brain, and only in the movie does the rainbow exist. In the real world, there is nothing there.</p>

<p>That is pure mysticism, because there is zero evidence for this ghost, and our senses are immediate, not playing on a screen in our heads. We directly perceive reality, with no second entity watching the process. In actuality, then, when we see a rainbow, we are meat and electricity responding to light waves being split by a prism of rain. There is no ghost, we are directly perceiving the phenomenon of light splitting, and how it affects our sense organs.</p> 

 <p>The issue of direct vs indirect realism is merely a language error based on a strange, but usually unseen, assumption. Let's look at defining what "I," or "you," or if both of us, or many people, "we," is. Generally speaking it is a person, or people. However, let's delineate further. Let's assume, hypothetically, that medicine has come to the point of development that we can switch out any body part on any person with another. Now, switching literally every part on a person BUT the brain means it is still the same "I" etc. If this were done, you would still have all of your memories, personality traits, and so on, albeit you might feel weird, due to having a new body, but you'd still be you. This would be the final part that would mean you are you. If we replace the brain with someone elses, then you'd be them! If  we chop out big sections of the brain, you'd be incomplete at best, missing parts of yourself, or, at worst, you'd be a vegetable. If we completely destroyed the brain, but the body still lived, it would be a body without any "I" inside of it. Clearly, the whole, intact brain is what is necessary to have the "I," "you," etc. Parsing it out, and what part does what, or even how it works and does what it does is irrelevant to the question of what we define as the minimum for you to be you. This is the easy version of the ship of Thesius question, since there is a final decider of what makes you you. Thus, the intact brain, unquestionably, is "you," the "I," etc.</p>

 <p>Now, with that cleared up, we look at the issue more specifically. Imagine a baby born without any of its senses connected to its brain. It would be senseless. If you could use ESP to see what it experiences, it would probably be next to, or actually nothing. It would be like deep sleep. Now this is where idealists would live. A mind with zero input, and zero knowledge is what idealists say we are. It is easy to see how silly that is for a theory to explain human life and experience, since we certainly have a lot more going on! The representationalist would say that this baby inexplicably starts learning, and perceiving the world, despite having ZERO connection with it. This is magical thinking. Now let's say a doctor does a surgery and connects all of the baby's senses to its brain. Wonderful! Now the baby can experience the world! Light from the external world goes into the baby's skull via the eye, which makes contact with the brain. Thus it is undeniable that the baby has contact with, and directly perceives the outside world, since the brain is the minimum definition of what the baby actually is, and it is certainly connected now. The "I" is the brain, and the brain has direct contact with the outside world via the eye, therefore the "I" has direct perception of the outside world.</p>

 <p>So, what is the representationalist confusion? They assume, implicitly or possibly explicitly, that there is a soul, or otherwise a second entity inside of our heads, in addition to our brains. There is the brain, and then there is an entity watching whatever the brain presents. This second entity has no access to the outside world, and can only watch whatever is playing on the brain tv. This is superfluous. There is no such thing, and there is no reason to think that there is. Further, once we draw this out, it becomes clear that if there were such a ghost in the machine, then there is no reason to say that it can't see through the walls of the skull to the outside world in the first place. That might even explain certain intuitions that puzzle us! There is also no reason to say that this entity couldn't hook itself up to the eye and see out directly, either, rather than just watching the brain tv. Nonetheless, however irrationally, the representationlist states that the entity has no access to the outside world whatsoever. The entity's implied existence is clear in that the representationlist cannot be considering the brain to be what has no access, because the brain unquestioningly does have access through the eye. If it didn't, We'd be senseless like the hypothetical baby, until we got surgery to fix this situation. </p>

 <p>To use that analogy again, we can actually make a representationalist position that is coherent: This time, the surgery doesn't connect the brain to the eyes. Instead, it connects some tech to the brain which includes a camera. That camera watches a screen which has a live feed of the outside world, which itself is connected to a machine eye, in place of the organic eye. Now we have a brain which watches the world, but never has any direct access to it. The brain only contacts a representation of the world via a computer screen. The brain sees strictly what is inside the skull. Meaning you only see inside of your own skull, and never outside of it. Everything you see is on a screen inside your skull. However, in the normal setup, the brain has direct access to the external world because it is directly connected to the eye. The brain sees with the eye, and the eye sees the outside world, because light from the external literally enters into the eye, and therefore the skull itself has the external world pouring into it.</p>

 <p>So, the brain, which is the "I", or "you" is connected to the outside world via the eye, so you experience the outside world directly. To say otherwise would be a misuse of language, and from there we could misuse it further to get back to the fact that you do experience the world directly, as demonstrated above, when I pointed out that this ghostly entity could see through the skull, or at least hook itself up to the eyes and see out for itself. It is imaginary, after all, and so doesn't have any limitations.</p>


 <p>Brain (which is you) = Y</p>
 
 <p>The Eye (which is direct contact with the outside world) = E </p>
 
 <p>When we connect Y and E we get You having direct contact with the outside world. Light from the outside world pours into the eye, actually inside the skull, and thus gets to you, the brain, because it is physically connected to the eye, and so you experience reality immediately, instantly, and directly. It is irrelevant as to how you process the light and information, the point is that you are getting it directly from the outside world, and that is true beyond question. You perceive light directly from the outside world via the eye. The light literally goes inside of your skull, via the eye, which is directly connected to your brain, and your brain does its thing. The idea that you, that is to say, the brain, never has contact with the outside world is thus absurd, and completely defeated. The brain is you, and the brain is demonstrably, clearly connected to the eye, which has the outside world pouring into it. Only if the eye was not connected to the brain, and the brain saw what the eye sees through a second eye, or a camera, like in the example above, might we say that the brain never has direct contact with the outside world.</p>

 <p>It really is just that simple. All of the ostensible riddles surrounding this issue are mere language games. Obfuscation caused by misuse of language to create problems that are only apparently solvable, when in reality they are nonsense. The representationalist essentially wants us to answer the nonsense question: "Is your perception of direct perception of the outside world direct?" This is nonsense, and in reality, the question is simply "Is your perception of the outside world direct?" And, as demonstrated easily above, the answer is a simple, "Duh. The brain, which is you, is directly connected to the eye, which has the outside world pouring into it. So your perceptions are direct."</p>

 <p>A few things to address: The time lag argument is irrelevant, here, because I'm only talking about light. So, yes there is a microsecond of time lag between the time the light hits and object and enters your eye, but you are still aware of light from the outside world, and the information about objects that it carries. Further, the time lag is insignificant except for absurdly distant things like stars. When you look at the table in front of you, it is irrelevant that the light takes some ridiculously tiny amount of time to reach your eye. Finally, most arguments against direct realism rely on minute delineations of the perceptual process, such as how objects appear from different angle, whether or not we perceive things all at once or not, and other things. Pierre Le Morvan has expertly defeated each of the eight main arguments against direct realism in his paper "Arguments Against Direct Realism and How to Counter Them." I was going to list them out in my own words, but, save the time lag argument, none of this is relevant to my position that we perceive light. We do, and it comes directly from the external world. Thus, we perceive the external world directly, in the form of light. That this light gives us a great deal more information than just brightness, and  awareness of purely light, is beyond question, but discussing it further is fruitless, since it already unquestionably establishes direct realism, and direct contact with the outside world.</p>

 <p>A relevant point made by the Vaibhasika about the irrationality of representationalism:</p>

 <p>"The Vaibhasika contends that it is self-contradictory to assert that sensible objects are inferrible. The Sautrantika holds that external objects are inferred, and never perceived. But inference is based on an observation of invariable concomitance (vyapti) between the mark of inference and the inferred property. This invariable concomitance is the ground of inference, and cannot, therefore, be derived from inference. Hence it must be derived from perception. Thus perception is the ultimate ground of inference. But the Sautrantika denies perception of all objects. If there is no perception of an external object, it can never be an object of inference. Besides, the SautrSntika doctrine contradicts the experience of all mankind. Everybody directly perceives external objects. Therefore the representative theory of perception is wrong. The Vaibhasika recognizes the existence of external objects which are directly perceived. He holds to the doctrine of direct realism. He believes in the presentative theory of perception."
  -ibid p 59-60
 </p>

 <p>Another is the argument that because hallucinations are possible, then realism is defeated. Well, no. Any rational person can tell that seeing a pink rat when someone is extremely drunk is a wildly inconsistent event, assuming they have normal perception the rest of their lives. Further, such things are explainable via the brain, and how it is affected by alcohol, and so on, and these things are testable, in that one could construct a trap, and if the rat is not caught, then it is not real, and so on. Yes, unreal things appear as a defect sometimes, but the real vastly outnumbers the defects under normal conditions.</p>

 <p>In summary, what the representationilsts do is take an undeniable, simple point, which is that the brain perceives light via the eye, and obfuscate it by taking things in bizarre directions, and involving a lot of irrational conclusions about how perception works in ways that are largely subjective. As an example, one of the arguments against direct realism that I disregarded as meaningless was that we cannot perceive an object all at once. This is ridiculous, and does no damage to direct realism whatsoever. Most of the arguments are similarly ineffective, or even asinine. They all rely on ignoring the objective fact that light is getting in, and we are aware of it directly, and this simple point is all that is needed to demonstrate, conclusively and permanently, that direct realism and contact with the outside world is fact. It makes no difference if our brains might miss some points. Light gets in, light is real, the end. The rest is just details.</p>



<!-- Explain that the issue of direct vs indirect, without a ghost, is no different than a digital video camera with more or less layers of glass before image is created. No matter what, the image reaches the screen, and it's a direct result of the light bouncing off of the images. The camera gets a direct interaction with the world which makes the image. It is not a mere representation, forever cut off from the "real world," not at all. It is a direct image of the world, created by the light that touches objects carrying those exact same light waves with that information and then becoming an image on screen. In that moment, it is a direct, live experience of the same light. Humans are no different, except instead of layers of glass, and a screen, its layers of meat, and brain. The human experience is entirely direct. So, just like with a live video camera feed, no matter how many layers of glass or processes go on between the camera and its object, we don't ask "Does the camera experience this directly? Or only representationally?" Instead, we ask, "Is this a live/direct feed? Or is it delayed?" with humans, there is no delay that is relevant to human experience. The delay is only as long as light takes to reach the object, and it is then processed. Both events are instantaneous for all intents and purposes, and only by doing extremely minute studies of the events would we find any time scales at all, and they would be small to the extreme. Tiny fractions of seconds which are insignificant. This is the same with video cameras. We only consider a video camera delayed if there is a delay that is noticeable to us. For example, if someone walks into a door to a room we are in with a live feed on a video screen of that door, we call it a delay if the person walks in, and seconds later we see the event on the feed. If, on the other hand, we can watch the person on the feed approach the door, and then their entry coincides with the door opening in the actual moment as we see with our eyes, we say there is no delay. We don't talk about the extremely minute delay that exists due to how light travels.-->


<!-- Representational realism's position that we NEVER experience anything whatsoever from the outside world is untenable. Here is why: When we see smoke rising from a far away campsite, we assume there is fire. In our minds we make a representation of what is going on in the campsite. This is because we have previous experiences of smoke, and of fire, and so can make this representation. In representational realism, however, since we NEVER have any contact with the outside world, this would be impossible. We would have zero information to make a representation of reality from. We would be senseless, having zero information inside our minds, and so explaining how we get around and survive would involve some kind of mysticism, or, at best, a mystery. Now, we don't really know how the brain works. So, if the human organism was completely sealed, and had no sense organs, we might say that we don't know how it makes an image of the outside world, and that it inexplicably has representations of it, as in representational realism. Likewise, if the human organism was completely sealed, but shot out lasers to analyze the world, and then built an image of it off of those results, we might say it only experiences representations of the world, created by its laser scan results. However, the eye is is receptive. Light from the outside world literally goes inside of it. The external world literally penetrates the human skull! How it is then processed is unknown, but this is enough to defeat the bizarre, and obviously false idea that we never experience the external world. We literally, directly experience light from the outside world, inside our skulls, which our brain interacts with in unknown ways that allow us to get around in the world with great efficacy. -->

<!-- To reiterate the above point with an analogy: Imagine an alien astronaut floating over a planet in a space pod. We know the alien is sentient, and percipient, but we have no idea whatsoever how its senses work. All of the pod's sensing instruments are broken, so the astronaut is imagining what the planet looks like. This is idealism. Now imagine the sensors touch the surface of the planet with lasers, and then a machine on the inside of the pod makes a representation of the planet with clay. This is representationalism. Now, finally, imagine there is an apparatus outside the pod that allows light to actually bounce from the planet, and back into the pod, where it hits the alien astronaut. This is direct realism. Yes, there is a glass window of many layers between the astronaut and the image, but the image is real. It is real light that is carrying a real image of which the astronaut is directly aware. The process of human perception is even more direct, because there is no pod between us and the window. In actual perception, light from the external makes its way into the eye, and is perceived by the brain, it is a direct experience of the light from the external world. The only way to argue that experience is not direct would be if the light didn't actually get into the eye, and if, instead, the human body shot out lasers, like the astronaut's pod, and then created an image inside, based on these results. In actuality, though, the light carrying the information does penetrate the human eye. The external actually, literally goes inside of the skull directly, and we are directly aware of it. How the brain actually processes it is irrelevant, and we are not quite sure how that works, anyway. The point is simply the fact that light enters the skull from the outside world defeats all other explanations of perception, namely idealism and representationalism, and demonstrates that direct perception is fact. You actually get light from the outside world inside your skull, and perceive it directly. -->

<!-- The argument that we only perceive a representation of reality is based on two false assumptions: 1.) That there is a ghost inside the skull that is completely cut off from the outside world, and that it is watching a representation of reality. 2.) That the process by which the representation is created is understood. 
  
  Both are false. There is zero evidence of a ghost to be viewing this representation, and the process is not understood. All we know is that light from the outside world comes in direct contact with the brain via the eye, and that we are aware of the world in this way. Everything else is speculation. If we really understood how the brain works like we understand simpler things, like, say, how water molecules from from hydrogen and oxygen, then, like we can literally make water by combining hydrogen and oxygen, we'd be able to make the images the brain makes in the same way that the brain makes them! This is laughably far off and beyond what we can do, though. We have only theories and inklings about how the brain works. That said, even when we do some day fully understand how it works, we still must admit that the brain directly accesses the outside world via the eye, and mirrors reality. We don't question whether or not mirrors are experiencing the outside world! Or, perhaps a better analogy would be a computer. Imagine a computer with no camera attached. It makes images based on text input. This is representational realism. Now give it a camera with a live feed of the outside world. This is direct realism. It makes no difference as to HOW the computer processes the information and makes the image. It's all about whether or not the images are live, and coming from light that is from the outside world.  -->

<!-- So, where does this argument about perception come from? The misuse of language. People ask strange, looping questions about what being aware is. "When we are aware of reality, are we really aware of being aware?" *make this a better comparison for realism arguments" And similar nonsense. In reality, light from the outside world enters the skull through the eye and is perceived in unknown ways by the brain. It is quite clear that the brain, then has direct contact with the outside world, via the eye. That's all there is to it. -->

<!-- If this be not direct realism, than nothing short of putting the image of awareness inside the skull of the viewer could truly be direct, as the light, even if it shot directly inside the skull, is still, technically, only a representation of the object, not the object itself. From here, there is no such thing as perception unless you take two objects and jam them together, so that one is inside the other! This, obviously is ridiculous.  -->


<!-- I believe the position that only indirect realism can be correct is based on soul theories, even if subconsciously. I'll try to demonstrate this simply, without being verbose. Take a small plant. It senses light, and this light, having been sensed by external cells, then has effects inside the plant. We don't bother discussing how the plant experiences the world because we don't see them as that type of entity. Now, imagine we believe that plants have souls, and do experience the world. Imagine we think there's a little consciousness inside the plant, looking out. Now we have to discuss whether the conscious soul inside actually experiences the light or not. Does the soul actually see, if it only gets information sent to it from cells on the outside, while it is inside?

The same is true with humans. If we see the process of perceiving light as a process no different, though albeit more complex, but nonetheless ultimately the same, than a plant sensing light, there is no issue. But if we imagine that there is a soul piloting the human, now we have to consider if the soul inside really experiences the outside world or not. Hence, if we don't believe there is a ghost in the machine of the human body, there is no one to have a representation of the outside world, there are just light and other phenomena sensors that trigger certain things inside the body, and so on.

In other words, if a suit of armor has a camera hooked up to it, we don't discuss whether or not it directly perceives the world. We take for granted that the camera has sensors that are picking up light and other information from the world. Put a person in the suit, now we have something to discuss. Likewise, if the human body is just a suit of meat armor with a camera, no need to discuss this, but if there's a soul inside, we have to discuss it.

A special entity that is imaginary, and has no support in science, is required to have representational realism: a ghost. There must be a ghost to be seeing this "representation" of reality. If there is no ghost inside, who is watching? If there's no ghosts, then perception is just a process of sensors triggering chemical responses and synapses firing. There is no little man inside the skull watching a screen that represents the "outside world." Without ghosts the very idea of indirect or representational realism is superfluous at best, and completely irrational at worst.

....

Not at all. We are conscious, as in an electrical process. There is no ghost sitting inside watching a screen of the outside, though. Since we are simply conscious, but there is no ghost, there is no reason to delineate about direct or indirect realism. Light bounces off of objects, hits our eyes, triggers things in our brains and we become conscious of them, in the same way an electronic camera picks up images and so on. We don't debate whether an electronic camera really experiences the outside world, because we don't think cameras have ghosts inside them. Cameras are accepted as having light sensors and so on which are triggered by the world and which directly take in the light from the outside world and make an image. We don't make up a story and say that the camera must be watching the images inside of itself and never actually experiences the objects themselves, that would be nonsense. Likewise, If we are conscious, but there's no delineation between a ghost mind and the physical body, then there is no ghost mind to watch the representational reality. There's just a consciousness directly perceiving the world. 

Thus, I believe that if religion, and other hocus pocus ideas about ghosts and souls and such, had never been developed, there would never have been this debate about whether or not we perceive things directly, since the presumed "we" in this sentence is a ghost, spirit, magical entity that doesn't exist. Without this false dichotomy, it doesn't even make any sense to say "we never experience the outside world". Who doesn't experience it? The material body and its dependent consciousness certainly experience it. If they didn't, then there is no separate entity to have that represented version of reality. There's just the material body and mind, that's it.

...

Studied Buddhism for 20 years lol! That's probably why I sound the way I do. Traditional Theravada Buddhism (what I preferred, Mahayana, which I studied but then rejected entirely, is almost entirely subjective idealism, extreme nihilism, or relativism, or all three mixed up) teaches that we are utterly devoid of anything even resembling a soul, even going so far as to say humans are no different than marionettes, and that there is no doer (see Visuddhimagga, VIII.31, XIX.20). It is vehemently atheistic, and opposed to all possible versions of anything even resembling a soul. It even rejects the use of the phrase "I am" as a conceit to be eliminated (Visuddhimagga III.122). In such a world, the very idea of indirect realism is nonsense, as every formulation involves someone seeing a representation of reality, but from this perspective, there is no one to see this representation, but rather there are just inanimate objects interacting with each other. Hence, you wouldn't say a rock that rolls down a hill didn't really experience the hill directly, because what in the world would that even mean? Likewise, if we are merely meat animated by electricity, it is nonsense to say we experience things indirectly. There are meaty blobs of matter animated by electricity who have sensors that are affected by other matter. Ditto for cameras, and any and everything else. From this perspective, talking about indirect realism is completely irrational, as we would be ultimately inanimate objects.

 

That said, I am realizing this is not the Objectivist way, and that this philosophy involves a very different understanding of consciousness. My mistake! I guess I need to read more about it! I really wasn't trying to say that my understanding was right. I was actually hoping for exactly what Boydstun provided: lots of quotes and references defending direct realism! I only submitted my own ideas as a side note, and merely as musings, in order to contribute, even in a small way, to the defense of direct realism generally. I seem to have failed, and have zero problem with this. I don't see myself as an expert on these matters. I'm responding to you because your critique was respectful, mature, and politely written, and I sincerely thank you for that.-->

<p>Back to the point made by the philosopher quoted above. The bizarre thing is that this philosopher, Tsong Khapa, was part of a school, known as Madhyamaka, that frequently argued against a lot of down to earth, commonsense worldviews. The thing is, though, they had two positions:
  <ol>
    <li>The ultimate reality, which is where they argued against the existence of literally everything, including their own positions, and they were well aware of this, and openly admitted exactly this regularly.</li>
    <li>Conventional reality (aka commonsense reality), which is what I've been talking about throughout. </li></ol>
   
  <p>This philosophy school, paradoxically, fiercely defended BOTH positions. In fact, one of the most brilliant thinkers in history, Chandrakirti, was from this school, and wrote an excellent refutation of idealism, while at the same time maintaining the ultimate non existence of everything. Here is Chandrakirti on the matter:</p>
 
  <p>"[The Yogacarin asserts] Where no object exists, no subject can be found, and therefore the bodhisattva understands that the triple world is merely mind. Relying on wisdom, he further realizes that reality itself is mind alone. ... [The Prasangika responds] ... Both the hair perceived under the influence of opthalmia and the cognition associated with the infected sense organ are real, relative to that cognition. However, for one who clearly sees the object, the two of them are fictitious. If cognition were to exist in the absence of any object of knowledge, then when the eye was directed toward the place where the hairs [were seen], even a person not afflicted with opthalmia should perceive them. This is not what actually happens, though, and therefore this [thesis] is untenable. ... [The Yogacarin asserts] THe production of visual cognition occurs complete and without delay from its own [ripened] potentiality. What is [commonly] understood to be the physical organ of the eye is actually just this potentiality, which is the source of its own cognition. Normally, a person imagines that [the cognition of color] arises from the sense organ. He does not understand that the appearance of blue, for example, arises from its own seed without any externally apprehended object, and on this account he assumes that such an object is present.[However this is not the case.] As in a dream the mental image of a discrete objective form arises from its own ripened potentiality in the absence of any such [actual form], so it is here in waking life also- mind exists in the absence of any eternal object. [The Prasangika responds] Since in a dream the mental cognition appearing as blue, for example, arises in the absence of an eye, then why is [such a mental cognition] not similarly produced from its own seed here [in waking life as well] to a blind man without any visual organ? According to you, in the dream [of a blind man] there is ripened potentiality for the sixth [sense of mental cognition], while in waking life there is none. If this is so, then why would it be unreasonable to suppose that in the same way [the blind man possesses ] no ripened potentiality for the sixth [sense] here [in waking life]. Similarly, sleep also cannot be posited as a cause [for vision] in the dream. It follows that in a dream as well as in [waking life], the [perceived] object and the eye provide [coefficient] causes for conceptualization of a fictitious entity. An opponent is refuted by perceiving that each and every response he offers is nothing but an unsubstantiated thesis. The buddhas did not teach that any entity whatsoever [ultimately] exists. The meditator (yogin) who follows his teacher's instructions sees the surrounding area to be filled with skeletons. In this case it is obvious that all three [factors of sensation] are unproduced, because this is an exercise in artificial mentation. According to our opponent, even these impure mental [visualizations] are just like the [conventional] objects of sense perception. If this were so, then anyone else [besides the meditator] who looked at the place where they appear should perceive the skeletons. They are fictitious, however, and are not [perceived by anyone other than the meditator].</p>
  
  <p> ... The word “only” has no capacity to negate the objective component of knowledge (jneya). ...

    “…the Lankavatara sutra substitutes “mind alone” for “mind alone is preeminent in the context of everyday experience.” The meaning of this scripture is not to be understood as a negation of form.”
   
    …When the scripture says “mind alone exists; form does not,” this is taught to deny the importance of form and so forth, not to negate their very existence…
   
    If he intended to deny the existence of objective reality wen he said that [the world] is mind alone, then why would the mahatma declare, in the same text, that mind is produced from delusion (moha) and volitional action (karman)?
   
    What sensible person would look at a passage from this same [Dasabhumikasutra] and imagine that consciousness exists as an independent thing (vastutah)? A notion like this is nothing more than dogmatic opinion. It follows that the expression “mind only” serves only to clarify that mind is the most significant element [in experience] This text should not be understood to assert that there is no objective form (rupa).... One can certainly maintain that objective form exists. ... [Refutation of a noncognized entity (reflexive awareness) as the ultimate truth]

    If this “dependent entity” exists in the absence of both subject and object, then who is aware of its existence? It would be unacceptable to assert that it exists unapprehended.
   
    It is not proven that [a cognition] is aware of itself. Nor can this be proven by using the subsequent memory [of a previous event as evidence], for in this case the thesis intended to substantiate your claim itself embodies an unproven premise, and therefore it cannot be admitted [as valid proof].
   
    Therefore, without [this notion of] reflexive awareness who (or what) will apprehend your dependent [form]? The actor, the object [of the action], and the action are not identical, and for this reason it is illogical to maintain that [a cognition] apprehends itself.
   
    However, if the entity which is [a manifestation of this] dependent form (paratantrarupavastu) exists without ever having been produced or cognized, then why should our opponent insist that [belief in] the son of a barren woman is irrational? What harm could the son of a barren woman inflict on him [that he has not already suffered through belief in his concept of dependent form]?
   
     And in the event that this dependent [form] in no way whatsoever exists, then what will function as the cause for the screen [of conventional truth]? All the ordered structure of everyday experience is laid waste by this clinging to a real substance inherent in our opponents philosophical views. ... Conventional truth is the means, the truth of the highest meaning is the goal, and one who does not appreciate the distinction between these two treads a wrong path through his reified concepts. We [Madhyamikas] do not have the same attitude toward our [concept of] the screen as you [Yogacarins] have toward your [concept of] dependent being (paratantrabhava). With reference to the nature of everyday experience, we say: “Even though things do not exist, they exist” - and this is done for a specified purpose.

  [The things of the world] do not exist for the saints who have abandoned the pyschophysical aggregates and found peace. If, in a similar manner, they did not exist in the context of everyday experience, then we would not maintain that they do - even in this qualified sense.
   
  If everyday experience poses no threat to you, then you may persist in this denial of the evidence provided by such experience. Quarrel with the evidence of everyday experience, and afterward we will rely on the winner."</p>

  <p>"...the objects encountered in everyday experience are taken for granted on the consensus of that experience, and any attempt to negate them may be effectively countered by relying on the testimony of just that everyday experience."

  The members of this school saw no conflict in defending both positions, yet, Kumarila Bhatta, also known for his genius and refutation of Buddhist idealism, who was of the Mimamsa school (a very interesting sect of Hinduism, look it up!) certainly noticed, as can be seen by his words on the matter of the Madhyamaka philosophy:</p>

<p>"Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine</p>
  Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century Mīmāṃsā philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa rejected the Two Truths Doctrine in his Shlokavartika. Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval Buddhist rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India[61] since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd: Kumārila Bhaṭṭa:
 
  "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of samvriti satya. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth? Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive. On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word vaktrasava [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word lala, meaning saliva [vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat]. But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so. Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."

  <p>And here he is on Yogacara idealism specifically:</p>

</p>"The Thesis Is Self-Undermining
For Kumārila, not only is the Thesis called into question by perceptual and inferential counterevidence, but it also undermines itself in three different ways.
• No Difference Between Qualificand and Qualifier. First, the conclusion of any
argument makes sense only insofar as it involves two components. The first
is a qualificand (viśes.
ya), i.e., the site. In the Buddhist argument, the qualificand is the awareness of a pillar, etc… The second is a qualifier (viśes.an. a),
i.e., the target property that is inferred. In this case, it is supportlessness. But
if there are no distinct objects apprehended by awareness-events apart from
themselves or their aspects, then there can’t be any distinction between the
qualificand and the qualifier (v. 35)</p>

<p>Impossibility of Communication. The awareness of the qualificand and the
  qualifier, which arises in both the speaker and the hearer, doesn’t apprehend
  anything distinct from it. But the view that is being conveyed by the Thesis itself can only be known only if there are such objects. So, the Buddhist
  who puts forward this thesis is caught in a pragmatic contradiction: they assert something which, if true, cannot be known (and therefore shouldn’t be
  asserted) (v. 36).
  • Impossibility of Truth/Accuracy. Finally, if all awareness-events lack an objective support, then it’s impossible to undergo any true or accurate awareness
  at all (since truth, intuitively, involves some kind of correspondence with an
  independent reality). Various bad consequences will then follow.
  </p>
<p>The awareness as of the reason being present in the site is either true
or false. If it is false, then the view can’t be proved on that basis (vv.
74cd-75cd). If the awareness is true, then it is made true by some apprehended objects, i.e., by the site and its possessing awareness-hood.
So, at least, some awareness-events have to have an external objective
support (v. 75cd).
The Buddhist’s own awareness that awareness-events exist, and are distinct and momentary, must either be true or false. If it is true, that
awareness-event must have an external objective support, so the Buddhist’s argument fails. If it is false, the Buddhist can’t take their Thesis to
be true (since it presupposes or entails the existence of such awarenessevents) (vv. 81cd-82).
Finally, if the Thesis is qualified so that it only says that all awarenessevents other than the awareness-events about the site, the target property, or the reason, lack objective support, then we could still end up
with the conclusion that these awareness-events have an external objective support. But since they aren’t fundamentally different from other
waking awareness-events, we wouldn’t be able to rule out the possibility that those awareness-events also have an external objective support
(v. 76).
Upshot: the Thesis is self-undermining."
-Kumarila Bhatta, verses 35-76
</p>

<p>Here we see Ramanuja making a similar critique of Yogacara idealism:</p>

<p>"To maintain, as the Yogâkâras do, that the general rule of idea and thing presenting themselves together proves the non-difference of the thing from the idea, implies a self-contradiction; for ‘going together’ can only be where there are different things. To hold that it is a general rule that of the idea—the essential nature of which is to make the thing to which it refers capable of entering into common thought and intercourse—we are always conscious together with the thing, and then to prove therefrom that the thing is not different from the idea, is a laughable proceeding indeed."
  -Ramanuja, Vedanta sutra 2.2.28-2.2.31
</p>


 

  <p>Regardless, we might take the Madhyamaka arguments in a vaccuum, and separate the commonsense defense, and keep the truth in it for our purposes. Certainly, because the other arguments self refute entirely (see Stafford L. Betty's works on Nagarjuna for more on this), leaving only the defense of common sense as valid.</p>

  <p>A well known modern argument for common sense is G. E. Moore's "A Defense of Common Sense." Here is a selection: </p>

  <p>"All the four expressions I have just introduced, namely, “Material things are not real,” “Space is not real,” “Time is not real,” “The Self is not real,” are, I think, unlike the expressions I used in (1), really ambiguous. And it may be that, in the case of each of them, some philosopher has used the expression in question to express some view he held which was not incompatible with (2). With such philosophers, if there are any, I am not, of course, at present concerned. But it seems to me that the most natural and proper usage of each of these expressions is a usage in which it does express a view incompatible with (2); and, in the case of each of them, some philosophers have, I think, really used the expression in question to express such a view. All such philosophers have, therefore, been holding a view incompatible with (2).

    All such views, whether incompatible with all of the propositions in (1), or only with some of them, seems to me to be quite certainly false; and I think the following points are specially deserving of notice with regard to them:
   
    (a) If any of the classes of propositions in (2) is such that no proposition of that class is true, then no philosopher has ever existed, and therefore none can ever have held with regard to any such class, that no proposition belonging to it is true. In other words, the proposition that some propositions belonging to each of these classes are true is a proposition which has the peculiarity, that, if any philosopher has ever denied it, it follows from the fact that he has denied it, that he must have been wrong in denying it. For when I speak of “philosophers” I mean, of course (as we all do), exclusively philosophers who have been human beings, with human bodies that have lived upon the earth, and who have at different times had many different experiences. If, therefore, there have been any philosophers, there have been human beings of this class; and if there have been human beings of this class, all the rest of what is asserted in (1) is certainly true too. Any view, therefore, incompatible with the proposition that many propositions corresponding to each of the propositions in (1) are true, can only be true, on the hypothesis that no philosopher has ever held any such view. It follows, therefore, that, in considering whether this proposition is true, I cannot consistently regard the fact that many philosophers, whom I respect, have, to the best of my belief, held views incompatible with it, as having any weight at all against it. Since, if I know that they have held such views, I am, ipso facto, knowing that they were mistaken; and, if I have no reason to believe that the proposition in question is true, I have still less reason to believe that they have held views incompatible with it; since I am more certain that they have existed and held some views, i.e. that the proposition in question is true, than that they have held any views incompatible with it.
    …
    If this first point in my philosophical position, namely my belief in (2), is to be given any name, which has actually been used by philosophers in classifying the positions of other philosophers, it would have, I think, to be expressed by saying that I am one of those philosophers who have held that the “Common Sense view of the world” is, in certain fundamental features, wholly true. But it must be remembered that, according to me, all philosophers, without exception, have agreed with me in holding this: and that the real difference, which is commonly expressed in this way, is only a difference between those philosophers, who have also held views inconsistent with these features in “the Common Sense view of the world,” and those who have not.
   
    The features in question (namely, propositions of any of the classes defined in defining (2)) are all of them features, which have this peculiar property – namely, that if we know that they are features in the “Common Sense view of the world,” it follows that they are true: it is self-contradictory to maintain that we know them to be features in the Common Sense view, and that yet they are not true; since to say that we know this, is to say that they are true. And many of them also have the further peculiar property that, if they are features in the Common Sense view of the world (whether “we” know this or not), it follows that they are true, since to say that there is a “Common Sense view of the world,” is to say that they are true. The phrases “Common Sense view of the world” or “Common Sense beliefs” (as used by philosophers) are, of course, extraordinarily vague; and, for all I know, there may be many propositions which may be properly called features in “the Common Sense view of the world” or “Common Sense beliefs,” which are not true, and which deserve to be mentioned with the contempt with which some philosophers speak of “Common Sense beliefs.” But to speak with contempt of those “Common Sense beliefs” which I have mentioned is quite certainly the height of absurdity. And there are, of course, enormous numbers of other features in “the Common Sense view of the world” which, if these are true, are quite certainly true too: e.g. that there have lived upon the surface of the earth not only human beings, but also many different species of plants and animals, etc. etc."    
    -A Defense of Common Sense, G. E. Moore</p>

    <p>This is an amusing talk about the power of the common sense world against an idealist by Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher:</p>

    <p>"If I were a slave of one of these gentlemen, even at the risk of being whipped to the bone every day, I would never stop tormenting him.
    <p>  ‘Throw a bit of oil into the bath, boy.’</p>
     <p> I’d take some fish sauce and go and pour it over his head.</p>
    <p>    ‘What’s this?’</p>
      <p>‘ I had an impression that was indistinguishable from that of oil; it was just the same, I swear that by your fortune.’</p>
    <p>  ‘ Here pass me the gruel.’</p>
     <p> I’d bring him a dish full of vinegar.</p>
    <p>  ‘Didn’t I ask you for the gruel?’</p>
      <p>‘ Yes, master, this is gruel.’</p>
    <p>  ‘ But surely it’s vinegar?’</p>
 <p>     ‘ Why that rather than gruel?’</p>
    <p>  ‘Take some and smell it, take some and taste it.’</p>
  <p>    ‘ Well, how do you know, if it is true that our senses deceive us?’</p>
    <p>  If I had three or four fellow slaves who thought in the same way as I did, I’d soon make him explode with anger ... or else change his ideas.
      But as things are, men like this are making fun of us, they make use of all the gifts of nature while abolishing them in theory."
      -Discourses: 2:20</p>

      <p>Here is an argument of Aniol Dowgird, articulated by Jacek Jadacki:</p>

      <p>(1) Convictions, in which we recognize the reality of external objects, are
        not the result of reasoning.
        (2) These convictions are not random.
        Hence, he inferred that:
        (3) In accordance with the laws of the mind, they cannot be mistaken
        or uncertain.
        For suppose that is just as idealists preach, i.e. that no notions, caused by
        our images are corresponded by real objects, so that all our convictions in
        which we recognize the reality of such objects are wrong. The existence of
        sensory illusions would support it.
        But here, idealists make a mistake. First, the ingredients of insights be‑
        yond the feelings are notions (on this distinction – cf. below), and the latter
        are subject to the said rights of the human mind. Second, the decision that
        something is a sensual illusion is possible only on the assumption that some‑
        thing is not such an illusion, and the experience can decide which case we
        are dealing with. The assumption that everything the senses notify to us, is
        an illusion, is therefore untestable.
        It is also an untestable idealistic thesis that all our convictions in which
        we recognize the existence of external objects, are wrong. Also, a claim that
        some of these latter beliefs are wrong is untestable if we wanted to check
        their legitimacy by means of sensory experience, because the convictions of this kind are not a matter of sensual feel – but the natural principles
        governing the functioning of the mind."
      -Jacek Jadacki, Polish Philosophy, pages 174-175</p>

      <p>An example of another thing that is untestable, also known as not falsifiable, or "not even wrong": "Everything is an illusion, and in reality the universe is a giant space potato. This potato is impossible to detect, but I know it is the truth. Evidence for it is that you can't know it's not true, because of the fact that our senses are limited, and that some quantum experiments show that reality isn't real. This is because reality is space potato!" And so on. If it's not falsifiable, is untestable, and is therefore "not even wrong" then it's not a valid position, but rather is mere flight of fancy. Such things make fun movies and books, but have no place in rational, serious philosophy.</p>


      <p>One might wonder, what if one were to wake up tomorrow, and find that everything is dream-like, and reality could be controlled with the mind. Might one say, then "All is mind?" Well, we'd need to ask: Whose mind is it, anyway? Do you have complete control over everything, including your knowledge? If not, then there are still rules and limitations that wouldn't exist if it were truly <strong>your</strong> mind. If it were truly yours, you'd be able to do whatever you want. As opposed to the normal world, which isn't yours, and so includes a great deal of rules out of your control. In that case, it would be unknown what it actually was, which is to say, you'd not be able to have a valid position other than shrugging your shoulders. It could just as easily be an illusion cast by a wizard, or a drug trip, as it could be that reality is truly all <strong>your</strong> mind. So, then, under what conditions might we say "All is mind," and actually be correct? This would only be possible if you woke up and found that you had complete control over everything, and thus could declare it as yours, and also would be able to control your own knowledge, and access some level of knowledge that is far beyond all other humans. This knowledge would allow you to verify that your reality is, in fact, yours. It is <strong>your</strong> mind, no one elses. Since you'd have complete control, this would mean the only way you'd be able to have other than commonsense reality, and still have a valid position, would be to be an entity that is completely different than you are, and that any human is.</p>

      <p>Even with all of that in mind, we must still acknowledge that idealism is strictly an artifact of language. It has absolutely no place besides as part of a language game. On the other hand, realism is imminent. Realism is the default position of every animal and human who has ever lived. When the human puts food in the fridge, they know it is still there when they shut the door. When the wolf buries a bone, they know it is still there when they cover it with dirt. Only in a quirk of language can we even articulate such a bizarre position as "The food disappears when you turn around, and reappears when you look at it." Can a philosophy that has zero existence unless explained in detail, and which is utterly refuted by every natural facet of reality, including most language, really be anything but a linguistic quirk?</p>

      <p>I'll include an argument I had someone present to me against the position that Yogacara (and idealism in general) is merely language, and does not exist without it. This argument involves "Abhidharma" which is the technical, metaphysical teachings of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka schools, and "dhammas," which means something like "things," or sometimes microscopic elements, and "sabhava" which means, roughly, "own being.":</p>
        
        <p>"Yogācāra would agree that its Abhidharma is conceptual. The ultimate reality for them is beyond conception. The “thusness” of reality. They would agree that dhammas have sabhāva, but this sabhāva can only be known in a state of immediacy, without any conceptual overlay. ... Madhyamaka would also definitely agree that it’s all language. ... In other words, you just argued for Yogācāra and Madhyamaka. There are ways to argue against them, but this isn’t it. "</p>

    <p>This, however, is a mystical argument, not a philosophical one. Almost every religion claims that their truths are outside of language and conception. It's basically a mystical insurance policy against rational criticism. So, this is no different than how, when we're young, we just one up our friends by adding more super powers to our characters, until we just say, "My character is so powerful it's beyond language and conception!" It's not a legitimate philosophical argument, and in science, as above, it's what's known as "not falsifiable," or "not even wrong." Which is considered not scientific, not rational thinking, but rather is closer to make-believe, or just spouting random ideas. Just as easily as Yogacara and Madhyamaka may claim that refuting them does no damage because they are beyond language and concepts, so anyone else might say that their mystic position outstrips Yogacara and Madhyamaka because their mystic claim is even more authoritative, beyond language and concepts. We might also say that giant space potato that is undetectable except to those in the know refutes idealism, and that is just as valid, which is to say it is asinine gibberish.</p>
      
      <p>In other words, these are ludicrous claims that have no validity whatsoever, and certainly, they are merely language, too. No person who never learned a language of any kind whatsoever has ever come up with anything like idealism, etc. It would be impossible to think "All is mind," without words, concepts, nor language of any kind. A person raised by wolves could not fathomably come to such a conclusion. Finally, the language is self refuting, thus, if we then must look to whatever is beyond the language, there is nothing to look for in the first place. It's like if I were to say "My philosophy is that everything is true and false and one plus one is fifty." and when someone says "That's nonsense. Your position has no validity outside of language, and even within language, it self refutes." and I were to respond, "You just argued for my position, because I also claim that my position is beyond language and concepts, and that the language used to build it is not true. Yet, my positions is still true." It's a game, it's nonsense, it's not legitimate. </p>
    
    <p>And, again, let's say, for a moment, that language is valid for idealists, hypothetically. If this were true, then why do they still age, and die? Why can't they fly? If it were really true that all is mind, and that they'd tapped into some ultimate truth, then the ancient Buddhist idealists would still be around today, flying around and freeing the rest of us from our delusions. On the other hand, let's go back to reality, in which language is out, because they self refuted. If the Yogacara masters really accessed some crazy thing beyond language, we should see some serious evidence for that, similar to above. Instead, Vasubandhu and Asanga (founders of Yogacara) died over a millenium ago. They spent their lives eating, drinking, and living like realists, and then died exactly as realists say they would. Their idealism existed striclty within their self refuting linguistic game, and their mystical claims that their truth was somehow beyond language and concepts. Those in the know in Yogacara ostensibly should have some specially ability, yet this ability has zero effect on anything whatsoever, and they eat, drink, and eventually die like the rest of us. Sounds a lot more like religious/cult thinking than philosophy.</p>

    <p>Hence, when we argue using reason, rational thiking, and logic, Yogacara and Madhyamaka cease to be valid. If we inexplicably included and considered as valid the claim that their teachings are true beyond all language, which, of course, puts it beyond all reason, rational thinking, and logic, then we've accepted their religious claims on faith alone. Further, as above, we could easily counter that with, "No, MY teaching is the most true, and better than yours, and is also outside of language and concepts!" These are not provable claims. They are nonsense arguments.</p>

    <p>It might help to look at philosophy from afar, too. When we view it over all of recorded history, we see what is known as the fallacy of composition being made throughout. This would be like if you saw a bus, and, since its tires are rubber, you conclude that the whole thing, from the body, to the engine, steering wheel, lights, and so on must be rubber, too. This is fallacious reasoning. Now, look at ancient man. He looked at the earth, and the animals, and decided the whole universe was the earth, sitting on several elephants, balancing on a turtle. Or he looked at the ocean which borders land, and concluded that the whole universe is an ocean. Other ancients looked at themselves, and said that the whole universe is one big person. Later people saw that they have minds, and declared that the whole universe is mind. Today, people look at technology, and claim the whole universe is technology. See the pattern? We look back on ancient man and laugh at their fallacy of composition. How absurd that the whole universe is an ocean! How silly that the whole universe could be one big person! Yet, we respect those today who claim the exact same thing, but have merely chagned out a term in their fallacious assumption. Might we refrain from making egregious claims of what the whole universe must be, in order to avoid falling into this pattern of flawed reasoning? </p> 

      <p>A very fair question at this point would be: "Why in the world is the author of this article so down on idealism?" Well, idealism is either evil, or pointless, and a waste of time. How might it be evil? Imagine someone who truly believes it. Not like 99.99999% of idealists who talk the talk of the idealists, but strictly walk the walk of the realists. I mean someone who <strong>really</strong> believes it, and so who walks into traffic without looking both ways, who ceases to eat and drink, and so on. They would be dead in a week! This is evil. Telling someone that everything is imaginary, which, if taken literally, is a fatal position, is evil. That's an extreme example, and let's hope no one actually takes idealism as actually true! Now, a much more common version of this is where someone will still keep themselves alive, but will make other choices that are less than desirable. For example, they might pay their bills, and look both ways in traffic, but they might drink too much, and eat unhealthy foods, justifying it with "It's all imaginary! Who cares?" They might also become immoral for the same reason. What does it matter if you steal something that is imaginary? What does it matter if you lie about your own mistake, and blame a coworker to save your own butt at work if they, and the job, and everything is imaginary? And so on.</p>

      <p>How is it a waste of time, and pointless? Well, what point is there in spending hours, days, years and countless pages of text on a philosophy that you preach but <i>never practice</i> literally <strong>never</strong>? And, again, we might point out that all of the logic that demonstrates the non-validity of idealism applies to all positions which similarly attack common sense.</p>

   <p>The net positive, here, is that if you ever feel out of it, that's not the time to start building a philosophy like idealism, or anything else that attacks commonsense reality. Such a position, as mentioned, repeatedly, above, would be self refuting. Instead, when under a lot of stress, and feeling confused, this is the time to <i>relax</i>. This is the time to take Sextus's advice posted above: Attain tranquility through letting it go! Things are going strangely, so just chill out, and be without a position.</p>

   <p>Why is commonsense reality a given, and not idealism? Well, commonsense reality imputes itself on us whether we like it or not. It is entirely consistent, and shared by all. It exists without language and explanation. It also acknowledges things as real, and stable, and thus the position is real, and stable. It does not self refute. Further, there is no claim of "I" on commonsense reality. It is just "reality." We don't have to ask "Whose reality is it, anyway?" </p>

   <p>This leads me to another interesting perk of philosophy: since we can't say anything is truly, ultimately "I" or "mine," due to having complete control over nothing at all, then there isn't really any such thing as the ultimate subjective, as in something that is the true, ultimate "mind." As above, this would exist for some different kind of entity, but not for humans. Thus, the objective has a pretty strong case, since there is an infinite number of things that are out of our control. And the subjective has a very weak status, since it includes only a very small section of experience. Even within that section, we have to admit it's not totally ours, since we don't have total control over things like drowsiness, feeling sad, and many other things. So, there surely is <i>something</i>, that's beyond question, and is self evident, and unavoidable, but there is no reason to believe that the mind is anything as lofty as being <strong><i>everything</i></strong>.</p>

   <p>In conclusion, commonsense reality is the foundation of all that you are and ever will be. Attack it at your own peril. It is the height of hubris to think one could possibly refute one's own mind and senses and still make sense!</p>
 
   <p>Is my reasoning simplistic? Is it minimalist? Yes, absolutely. This is by design. Richard Feynman said:</p>

   <p> "If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it."</p>

   <p>Keep that in mind when someone blathers on into extremely complicated language and ideas to prop up idealism, or any other wild philosophy which ostensibly destroys commonsense reality utterly. The burden of proof is on them for claiming such a thing. If they can't prove it immediately and directly, but rely on multi layered verbal arguments, or on infinitesimally tiny things that are totally imperceptable, and rely on many levels of inference, and despite all that are still easily refuted, and self refuting to boot, then they have no case. Tell them to give you a call when they learn psychokinesis, and can wish their electric bill away. Until then, they have no case.</p>

  <p>As an interesting aside, while Buddhism is known for its later iterations in the shape of Madhyamaka relativism and Yogacara idealism, both of which are Mahayana Buddhism created hundreds of years after the historical Buddha had already died, the earlier form of Buddhism, Theravada, which is based on texts that are thought to have been composed while the Buddha still lived, was overtly realist, as are the texts themselves, as can be seen by the following:</p>

    <p>“Bhikkhus, consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad. And how, bhikkhus, does consciousness come to be in dependence on a dyad? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness."
      -Samyutta Nikaya 35.93</p>
   
   <p> "A given instance of perceptual consciousness is said to arise only in dependence upon two conditions: the sense organ and its corresponding object-field. This implies that perceptual consciousness arises only in conjunction with an appropriate and existent object; perceptual consciousness of a nonexistent object or without an object is, therefore, impossible."

   <p> “And what is it, bhikkhus, that the wise in the world agree upon as existing, of which I too say that it exists? Form that is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this the wise in the world agree upon as existing, and I too say that it exists."

    <p>“Student, suppose there were a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms, who could not see blue, yellow, red, or carmine forms, who could not see what was even and uneven, who could not see the stars or the sun and moon. He might say thus: ‘There are no dark and light forms, and no one who sees dark and light forms; there are no blue, yellow, red, or carmine forms, and no one who sees blue, yellow, red, or carmine forms; there is nothing even and uneven, and no one who sees anything even and uneven; there are no stars and no sun and moon, and no one who sees stars and the sun and moon. I do not know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist.’ Speaking thus, student, would he be speaking rightly?”

      “No, Master Gotama. There are dark and light forms, and those who see dark and light forms…there are the stars and the sun and moon, and those who see the stars and the sun and moon. Saying, ‘I do not know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist,’ he would not be speaking rightly.”

    <p>"If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.

        <p>"Points of Controversy
          9.3 Of Matter as Subjective
          Controverted Point: Whether matter should be termed subjective or objective.
          
          Theravādin: If that is so, you must also affirm of matter or body, that it has the mental features of “adverting”, ideating, reflecting, co-ordinated application, attending, willing, anticipating, aiming—things which you would, on the contrary, deny of matter.
          
          All, or any of them you can rightly affirm of mental properties, such as contact (mental reaction), feeling, perception, volition, cognition, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, lust, hate, illusion, conceit, erroneous opinion, doubt, mental inertia, distraction, immodesty, indiscretion—all of which you admit as subjective. But matter is not one of these, and therefore such things may not be affirmed of it.
          
          You deny in the case of matter all those mental features—adverting, etc.—but claim for it the term “subjective”, which is really applicable to “contact”, sensation, etc. These, as you admit, do not lack those mental features named.
          
          Uttarāpathaka: But is not matter correlated (as an object)? Of course you assent. Then as correlated it is surely right to apply the term “subjective” to matter, etc. since “object” is one of the twenty-four (causal) relations."</p>
       
   
<p>It is the dhammas alone that possess ultimate reality: determinate existence “from their own side” (sarupato) independent of the minds conceptual processing of the data. Such a conception of the nature of the real seems to be already implicit in the Sutta Pitaka, particularly in the Buddha’s disquisitions on the aggregates, sense bases, elements, dependent arising, etc.,…
  …
  Thus by examining the conventional realities with wisdom, we eventually arrive at the objective actualities that lie behind our conceptual constructs. It is these objective actualities – the dhammas, which maintain their intrinsic natures independent of the mind’s constructive functions…
  
  …
  
  …the commentaries consummate the dhamma theory by supplying the formal definition of dhammas as “things which bear their own intrinsic nature” (attano sabhavam dharenti ti dhamma).
  …
  …concretely produced matter…possess intrinsic natures and are thus suitable for contemplation and comprehension by insight.
  …
  Great seers who are free from craving declare that Nibbana is an
  objective state which is deathless, absolutely endless, unconditioned,
  and unsurpassed.
  Thus as fourfold the Tathagatas reveal the ultimate realities—
  consciousness, mental factors, matter, and Nibbana."
  -Bhikkhu Bodhi, Acariya Anuruddha, A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, pages 3, 15, 26, 235, 260</p>

<p>Some have posited that perhaps nibbana is consciousness, or even the self, but this also is demonstrably false:</p>

<p>"...The Buddha declares that “all phenomena are nonself” (sabbe dhammā anattā), which means that if one seeks a self anywhere one will not find one. Since “all phenomena” includes both the conditioned and the unconditioned, this precludes an utterly transcendent, ineffable self."
  -Bhikkhi Bodhi’s footnote to the Ānanda Sutta (SN.44.10)</p>
  
  <p>So it's clearly impossible that it is a self.</p>

  <p>"viññāṇaṁ aniccaṁ
    Consciousness is impermanent"
    -Samyutta Nikaya 22.59</p>
  
    So it is clearly impossible that it is consciousness, as nibbana is stable (Samyutta Nikaya 43) and consciousness is, hundreds of times throughout the Pali Canon, said to be temporary.
  </p>

  <p>Consciousness that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change: this the wise in the world agree upon as not existing, and I too say that it does not exist.

    -SN 22.94</p>

  <p>“Where do water and earth,
    fire and air find no footing;
    where do long and short,
    fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly;
    where do name and form
    cease with nothing left over?”
    
    And the answer to that is:
    
    “Consciousness that’s invisible,
    infinite, radiant all round.
    Here’s where water and earth,
    fire and air find no footing;
    
    here’s where long and short,
    fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly;
    here’s where name and form
    cease with nothing left over—
    with the cessation of consciousness,
    that’s where this ceases.”
  -Digha Nikaya 11</p>

  <p>"At Savatthi. Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha: “Sir, is there any ... concsiousness ... at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever?” “Mendicant, there is no ... consiousness ... at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. There’s no feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.”

    Then the Buddha, picking up a little bit of dirt under his fingernail, addressed that mendicant: “There’s not even this much of any ... consciousness ... that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. If there were, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found. But since there isn’t, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found.
    
   ...
    
    What do you think, mendicant? Is form permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent, sir.” “Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” “Impermanent, sir.” … “So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’"
    -Samyutta Nikaya 22.97</p>

<p>    So from this and hundreds of similar quotes it's quite clear that nibbana is not consciousness as nibbana is permanent, and all consciousness is said to be temporary. A common argument against this is that nibbana supposedly is consciousness and is hinted at in other suttas and that the Buddha meant more than is stated in the above sutta, or that he was deliberately omitting listing some other type of consciousness every single time he discussed the aggregates or the temporary nature of all consciousness. The natural problem with that is that the Buddha said what he meant. If he said "All consciousness" then that's what he meant. This is apparent when we consider the following quotes:</p>

   <p> "I have taught Dhamma, Ananda, making no 'inner' and 'outer': the Tathaagata has no 'teacher's fist' in respect of the doctrines."
    -Digha Nikaya 12</p>
<p>
  No hidden teaching, he taught everything up front.</p>

    <p>"The acceptance of this dichotomy between conventional and transcendental language is widespread today, as is the suppositious parallel distinction between conventional and absolute truth, or reality. Therefore some may be surprised to learn that such a distinction (whether with regard to language, truth, or reality) ... is of later invention and is not to be met with in the Suttas. Quite the contrary, it is specifically and repeatedly condemned. At M. 99: ii,202, for instance, the Buddha goes out of his way to lead his listener to acknowledge the superiority of conventional speech (as well as of speech that is well-advised, spoken after reflection, and connected with the goal) over unconventional speech (and also over speech that is ill-advised, etc.). And consistent with this, at M. 139: iii,230 the monks are advised that when teaching they should (among other things) “not deviate from recognized parlance.
    
      The suttas, then, clearly assert that they are to be understood as saying what they mean. They are not to be interpreted, for to do so must result in misunderstanding them."
      -Samanera Bodhesako</p>
<p>
  The common argument from here is something like: "well nibbana is said to be consciousness in some suttas, and that nibbana consciousness is outside the all, so the Buddha omitted it every time he spoke about the aggregates."</p>
  
  <p>To reply to that we have:</p>

    <p>"nowhere in the Nikayas is Nibbana described as consciousness"
    -Bhikkhu Bodhi, note to Majjhima NIkaya 49</p>

   <p> and when people use "Consciousness non-manifest, infinite, radiant all around" from Digha Nikaya 11 amd Majjhima Nikaya 49 to prove that nibbana is consciousness they are missing two things:</p>
    
    <p>One: in MN 49 it is probably a typo,</p>
    <p>"
      the Sri Lankan, Thai, and English editions of the Pali attribute the phrase to Brahma, not the Buddha, while only the Burmese attributes it to the Buddha. (The commentary attributes it to the Buddha and says it refers to Nibbana; Burmese texts are notorious for incorporating ‘corrected’ readings from the commentary.)"
      -Bhikkhu Sujato, "Nibbana is still not Vinnana"</p>
    <p>And
    
      Two: for DN 11</p>
    
    <p>"It is in the next lines of the verse, which are usually overlooked by the viññāṇa = Nibbana school, that the Buddha’s true position is stated. With the cessation of viññāṇa all this comes to an end. The ‘infinite consciousness’ is merely the temporary escape from the oppression of materiality, but true liberation is the ending of all consciousness."
      -Bhikkhu Sujato "Vinnana is not Nibbana, really it just isn't"</p>

  <p>  Sujato also makes this excellent point:</p>
  <p>  "When passages such as the ‘anidassana vinnana’ or the ‘pabhassara citta’ are invoked to lend support for the notion that Nibbana is an eternal cosmic awareness that survives the death of an arahant, the first question we should ask is, ‘Do these phrases actually refer clearly to the state of an arahant after death?’ If they don’t, they are irrelevant to the problem. We all agree that an arahant is conscious before their death.
    
    Arguments for the ‘eternal-consciousness Nibbana’ almost invariably tend to slip from talking about the citta or vinnana in this life to the state after death. It is a subtle sleight of hand, which pivots on the ambiguity of the term Nibbana, and is hidden by the conceptual fog that mere mention of the term evokes."
    -Bhikkhu Sujato "Nibbana Remains Not Vinnana"</p>
<p>
  And of course the usual argument to all of the above is endless twisting and turning about the texts to prove that nibbana is self or consciousness or that there is a special consciousness outside the five aggregates that is self and so on. Taking the above into consideration, particularly that the Buddha said what he meant, we can assume that if nibbana was self or consciousness or if there were some special consciousness outside the aggregates, the Buddha would have stated it clearly and repeatedly as he did with most of his teachings.</p>
    
 <p>   Bhikkhu Sujato makes some points in this direction on his comments on his blog post on the matter:</p>
    
    <p>"The Buddha was so very very emphatic that the end of dependent origination was the end of all forms of consciousness. Making distinctions between “consciousness” and “awareness” and the like is no use, since these do not apply in the suttas: 
    
      Unfortunately, most Buddhist commentators on this point are not familiar with the relevant pre-Buddhist Upanishads; for in those texts, it is precisely vijnana (= Pali vinnana) that is the “Universal Awareness” that survives all. If you read what the Upanishads say about vijnana, side by side with what the Buddha says, it becomes perfectly clear that the Buddha was specifically adopting the Upanishadic terminology in order to refute it.
      
      If what the Buddha taught is really in essence the same as the Upanishads–and the ideas that you good gentlemen are talking about are, indeed, Upanishadic–then why was he so chronically unable to say so clearly? Why did he not repeat, as part of the basic definition of Nibbana, that it meant “an eternally lasting radiant omniscient transcendent consciousness”. It’s not so hard; I can do it, and the Upanishadic teachers could. Why did the Buddha, so extraordinarily clear and analytical in all things that matter, fail to say what he meant? Why, in all the dozens of epithets and descriptions of Nibbana, did he so scrupulously avoid anything that implies an existent state? Why, then, do those who search to validate such ideas in the Suttas constantly bringing up the same few, obscure passages of poetic or dubious interpretation? Passages which, moreover, have been shown time and time again to not mean what they are supposed to. The pabhassara citta in the canon, for example, clearly refers to the mind that is developed through samadhi; and if it can be developed it cannot be unconditioned. If actually you consider the passages that supposedly support the idea of Nibbana as a transcendental consciousness, they invariably undermine any such tendency by phrasing themselves in the negative: “There is the unborn…” It’s an emphatic assertion of a negative, not of a positive.
      
      Nibbana is supposed to be threatening. It’s supposed to be disturbing. That’s why, when the Devas or others of limited ability here of it, they are terrified and traumatized. Who gets traumatized by the idea that they will live forever as a transcendent consciousness? Nibbana poses the ultimate existential question, which is why the Buddha always described in ontologically in the negative. At the same time, however, he described it psychologically in the positive: the peaceful, the shelter, the cool, the ultimate bliss. But we can’t realize that state of peace as long as we still attach to refined forms of suffering such as a transcendent consciousness.""
      -Bhikkhu Sujato's comment on "Vinnana is not nibbana really it just isn't"</p>

    In summary: if nibbana were self or consciousness or if there was an extra consciousness outside the aggregates to facilitate these or other things, the Buddha would have said it, clearly and repeatedly, in many different ways in the thousands of suttas of the nikayas. Since he didn't, and actually ruled these ideas out hundreds of times and only a very few vague, sparse quotes support them, and then only with interpretation and explanation, we've much reason to side with Bhikkhu Sujato, all the other Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis who agree with him and the entire classical Theravada school.</p>

    <p>Other arguments rely on different angles, as can be seen below, and are just as unfounded, and just as easly discarded, and refuted:</p>

    <p>"Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:
      “Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?”
      “He could, Ānanda.”
      “But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?”
      “Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.’ It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient.”
      -AN 10.6</p>
<p>
  AN 10.6, 10.60, 11.8 and similar suttas are often used to argue that consciousness is eternal or that nibbana is consciousness, or both, or it somehow tied up with the nibbana is self or there is a self ideas.
  
  This is wrong. These suttas are clearly referencing a meditative attainment.
  They are speaking about saupadisesa nibbana (nibbana with residue; the five aggregates). This is how someone experiences nibbana while alive, and so does not prove that nibbana is consciousness, nor that an arhant will live on as consciousness after death. That would be a discussion on anupadisesa nibbana (nibbana without residue), which is not the topic of these suttas. The attainment of anupadisesa nibbana is spoken of in relation to nirodha samapatti by the Visuddhimagga:</p>

   <p>   "(v) Why do they attain it? Being wearied by the occurrence and dissolution of formations, they attain it thinking, “Let us dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and reaching the cessation that is Nibbána.”13
    13. “‘Reaching the cessation that is Nibbána’: as though reaching Nibbána without remainder of result of past clinging. ‘In bliss’ means without suffering” (Vism-mhþ 902)."
    -Vissuddhimagga XXIII 30</p>

      <p>Further, anupadisesa nibbana is stated in the suttas many times to be the end of all consciousness</p>

     <p> "When… consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”
      -SN 12.2</p>

      <p>See also the many other suttas quoted above.</p>
      
      <p>As referenced above in another, Bhikkhu Sujato states that this type of thing is sleight of hand, and I think it applies here to switching from talking about saupadisesa nibbana to anupadisesa nibbana.
      
        Now that that is cleared up and we know what we’re actually talking about the argument is usually that if one is able to experience nibbana while conscious, doesn’t that mean nibbana is consciousness? No, see all of the suttas and Venerable’s quotes above that rule this out.
  
        For example:</p>

 <p>     "nowhere in the Nikayas is Nibbana described as consciousness"
  -Bhikkhu Bodhi, note to MN 49</p>

      <p>And of course the many suttas that describe anupadisesa nibbana as the cessation of consciousness completely negate the idea that nibbana itself is consciousness.</p>
      
      <p>"The body broke up,
        perception ceased,
        feelings went cold
        — all —
        fabrications were stilled,
        consciousness has come to an end.""
        -Ud 8.9</p>

     <p> “Now what, bhikkhus, is the Nibbāna-element with no residue left? Here a bhikkhu is an arahant … completely released through final knowledge. For him, here in this very life, all that is experienced, not being delighted in, will be extinguished. That, bhikkhus, is called the Nibbāna-element with no residue left.
      “These, bhikkhus, are the two Nibbāna-elements.”
      These two Nibbāna-elements were made known
      By the Seeing One, stable and unattached:
      One is the element seen here and now
      With residue, but with the cord of being destroyed;
      The other, having no residue for the future,
      Is that wherein all modes of being utterly cease.
      Having understood the unconditioned state,
      Released in mind with the cord of being destroyed,
      They have attained to the Dhamma-essence.
      Delighting in the destruction (of craving),
      Those stable ones have abandoned all being."
      
      -It 44
</p>
<p>      Another idea may be that if consciousness experiences the unconditioned, that consciousness becomes unconditioned and therefore eternal.
  This is ruled out as a misunderstanding per MN 1</p>

  <p>    “He perceives Nibbāna as Nibbāna. Having perceived Nibbāna as Nibbāna, he conceives himself as Nibbāna, he conceives himself in Nibbāna, he conceives himself apart from Nibbāna, he conceives Nibbāna to be ‘mine,’ he delights in Nibbāna. Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say."
    -MN 1</p>
      <p>and as a wrong view per DN 1</p>
      
     <p> "that which is called “mind” (citta) or “mentality” (mano) or “consciousness” (viññāṇa)—that self is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and it will remain the same just like eternity itself.’
      
      …
      “When those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and non-eternalists in regard to other things proclaim on four grounds the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal—that too is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see; that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving."
      -DN 1
</p>
      From here the argument is usually that these suttas are talking about viewing eternal consciousness as a self, and so viewing eternal consciousness as not self is okay.
      
      This is ruled out by SN 22.97 (quoted above) also and other suttas.
   
      Consciousness depends on a dyad (SN 35.93, above), contact between a sense base and an object. In this case it is the mind base contacting nibbana and consciousness of nibbana arises. However consciousness is necessarily, and without exception, impermanent as stated in SN 22.97 and hundreds of other suttas throughout the Pali Canon.
      
      So can a person experience nibbana while conscious per AN 10.6, 11.8, etc.? Of course. But that in no way means that nibbana is self, consciousness or that consciousness is ever or can ever become eternal. And parinibbana is still the ending of all consciousness.</p>

      <p>Also notable is that the Buddha harshly rebuked someone for claiming that the same consciousness goes from life to life:<p>

        <p>Then the Blessed One said: "Sati, is it true, that such an pernicious view has arisen to you. ‘As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else’?"

          "Yes, venerable sir, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else."
          
          "Sati, what is that consciousness?"
          
          "Venerable sir, it is that which feels and experiences, that which reaps the results of good and evil actions done here and there."
          
          "Foolish man, to whom do you know me having taught the Dhamma like this. Haven’t I taught, in various ways that consciousness is dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet you, foolish man, on account of your wrong view, you misrepresent me, as well as destroy yourself and accumulate much demerit, for which you will suffer for a long time."</p>

          <p>Hence, the Buddha clearly taught that not only is consciousness impermanent overall, it's not even permanent from life to life. The Buddha taught, as is clear in the quotes above, that consciousness arises when contact is made with an object, for example, when seeing a table, consciousness of the table arises. When that consciousness ceases, it would then be replaced by a new, different consciousness (that is, unless one became entirely unconscious). The same is true at death. A being's consciousness dies/ceases, and a new, different one arises, only in this case it arises in a different body, caused by the previous consciousness, which has ceased entirely. It is like a fire catching new fuel on fire as it burns along a path. The new fire was caused by the old fire, but it is not the same fire. The fire started on one patch of grass, and spread. Now it may be a hundred feet away, burning a bush, and the original grass is not even on fire any longer. So, related fire, but not the same. This continues so long as we do not reach enlightenment. After we do, that consciousness ceases at death, and that's it. This makes quite clear why the Visuddhimagga states that consciousness ceases at parinibbana and does not arise again.</p>

          <p>Consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises. Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and thoughts is reckoned as mind consciousness.

            It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burns. A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire. A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire. A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire. A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire. A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire. A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire.
            
            In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises. …
          -MN 38</p>

          <p>When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops. In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling … Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.</p>

          <p>“Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and the ending of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. Listen …

            And what is the origin of the body? The body originates from food. When food ceases, the body ends.
            
            Feelings originate from contact. When contact ceases, feelings end.

          <p>after the last consciousness of the Arahant, who has
            abandoned arousing [future aggregates] and so prevented kamma from giving
            result in a future [existence], there is no further arising of aggregates of existence,
            and those already arisen have disappeared.

  <p>Mahasi Sayadaw sheds some light on the issue here:</p>

  <p>About the Nature of Nibbāna</p>
    <p>In the Pāḷi text of the Udāna the following passage occurs relating what Buddha uttered in triumph in relation to the nature of nibbāna. This utterance has been incorporated into the Canon as the Nibbāna-paṭisaṃyutta udāna.
    </p>
    <p>“Atthi, bhikkhave, tadāyatanaṃ, yattha neva pathavī, na āpo, na tejo, na vāyo, na ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ, na viññāṇañ­cā­yatanaṃ, na ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ, na nevasaññā­nāsaññā­yatanaṃ, nāyaṃ loko, na paraloko, na ubho candimasūriyā. Tatrāpāhaṃ, bhikkhave, neva āgatiṃ vadāmi, na gatiṃ, na ṭhitiṃ, na cutiṃ, na upapattiṃ; appatiṭṭhaṃ, appavattaṃ, anārammaṇamevetaṃ. Esevanto dukkhassā”ti. (Udāna v 71)</p>
    <p>
      “Monks! There is that base that has no elements of earth, water, fire, and air. It is neither the realm of Infinity of Space, nor the realm of Infinity of Consciousness, nor the realm of Nothingness, nor the realm of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. It is neither this world nor other worlds. No moon nor sun shines there. Here, monks, I say there is no going or coming. It has no foothold or residence. It is deathless, unborn, and unformed. It has no abode. Nothing ever occurs there. It has no sense-objects. It is the end of suffering.”</p>
    
<p>    Nibbāna is Real</p>
 <p>   Since nibbāna means the cessation of mind, matter, and mental formations, suggestions have often been put forward that it signifies nothing and is thus useless. However, nibbāna is absolute reality, the reality of the nullification of the activities of mind, matter, and mental formations to which the knowledge of the Path, Fruition, and reviewing (paccavekkhaṇa) is inclined. It is the mind-object to which this knowledge is directed. Buddhas, Arahants, and Noble Ones vouch for the truth of its reality. For the sake of argument, let us say that there is no nibbāna where all the cycles of defilement, actions, and results cease. Then no one in this Universe can find peace. In the absence of nibbāna, defilement will play havoc with our lives to produce action, which will bring about results, which will create conditions for the arising of a new group of aggregates attended by suffering. It is only the Path and its Fruition that can exterminate defilements, and this extermination will bring the cycle of suffering to an end. This cessation of suffering is real. Buddhas and Arahants actually reach this stage, and after their parinibbāna all sufferings come to an end.</p>
    
<p>    No Primary Elements in Nibbāna</p>
   <p> In nibbāna there are no element of earth or solidity, no element of water or fluidity, no element of fire or thermal energy, and no element of air or motive force that can usually be met with in the world of the senses, such as the world of men and devas, or in the world of Form, such as the world of corporeal brahmas, etc. Possessing solidity, men, devas, and brahmas assume shapes and forms. Cessation means the end of such shapes and forms that possess mass. In the absence of mass, there are no elements of fluidity, thermal energy, and motive force.
  </p>
   <p> Matter is Non-existent in Nibbāna</p>
<p>    In the absence of the four primary elements there can be no derived materiality (upāda rūpa) formed by these four elements, for instance, the eye and the sight, the ear and the sound, etc. Since they are absent there will be no phenomena of seeing, hearing, etc., which occur in the sensual realm as sense-sphere consciousness and in the Form Sphere as form-sphere consciousness.</p>
    <p>
      Consider this: without eyes one cannot see, without ears one cannot hear, without nose one cannot smell, without tongue one cannot taste, and without body one cannot get the sensation of touch. The physical sense bases are the seat of sensation, or the five sense organs that form the bases of consciousness. Devoid of the organs of sense, consciousness cannot arise. In the world of the brahmas, only the eye-base (cakkhu pasāda) and ear-base (sota pasāda) exist — nose-base (ghāna pasāda), tongue-base (jivhā pasāda), and body-base (kāya pasāda) being absent. So brahmas may possess noses and tongues in rudimentary forms or bodies or masses in great dimensions, but they do not know what smell is, what taste is, or what bodily impression is. However, there is the seat of consciousness usually called the heart-base (hadaya vatthu), in all sentient beings, whether celestial or human. So in these three realms, thought, knowledge, and absorptions can occur.</p>
    <p>
      As I have said, as there are no primary elements in nibbāna, all matter dependent on these four elements are non-existent. Because of the absence of matter, there is no consciousness appertaining to the realm of the senses or to the realm of form — as, for instance, the first jhānic consciousness. For brevity’s sake I will discuss only about mind (citta), but whenever mind is mentioned one must remember it is accompanied by mental concomitants (cetasikā). Now the question arises whether in nibbāna there are still extant consciousness that arises without depending on matter as, for example, formless consciousness.</p>
    
<p>    Absence of Formless Consciousness</p>
<p>    Here, the text is also very explicit about the absence of formless sphere consciousness in nibbāna, whether it be consciousness appertaining to the abode of the Infinity of Space, or to the abode of the Infinity of Consciousness, or to the abode of Nothingness, or to the abode of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. In the realm of the Infinity of Space, rebirth-linking begins with the advent of consciousness relating to kamma result, mind and mental concomitants. For ordinary people, during the course of existence between rebirth-linking and death, wholesome or unwholesome consciousness, together with their concomitants arise. When such ordinary people are duly trained in the Dhamma they are known as trainees (sekkha).</p>
    
<p>    Such trainees may become Arahants when they are reborn in the realm of the infinity of Space. In that case, only wholesome and functional consciousness arise together with their respective concomitants, but matter is absent there. Only mind and mental concomitants — all in a state of flux — are present. In that realm all phenomena are psychical. It just occurs to me that psychic beings need no food, clothing, or shelter, but it is usual for artists to depict this realm and others of the Formless Sphere as having palaces and mansions. However, in nibbāna they will be superfluous, as in nibbāna there is neither mind or matter.</p>
    
 <p>   Today non-Buddhists have become highly interested in space, but the space they have in mind is space in the physical sense. They may not be able to assimilate the idea of the existence of the realm of Infinity of Space, but the Buddha clearly differentiates the realm of mind and its constituents together with its state of absorptions from the realm of no-mind where all its concomitants and absorptions are nullified. A meditator who concentrates his or her mind on the rise and fall of the aggregates can aspire to reach the stage of knowledge of equanimity about formations. If he or she reaches that stage, he or she would feel the disappearance of the physical self, experiencing only a stream of consciousness that floats in space. As his or her knowledge progresses, this stream will become clearer and clearer. Strictly speaking, this is not absorption on Infinity of Space, but it is an insight akin to that absorption.</p>
    
  <P>  From the foregoing it may also be adduced that there is no consciousness and its concomitant appertaining to the realm of Infinity of Consciousness, and the same may be said of consciousness and its concomitant appertaining to the realm of Nothingness, and of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. The highest plane of existence is where perception is so subtle that it can be described as an intermediate stage between perception and non-perception. Equally subtle are contact, feeling, consciousness, and mental formations — concomitants of the mind that can be met with in that realm. In nibbāna such subtleties of the mind are entirely absent.</P>
    
 <p>   Those lacking confidence in the Dhamma and unable to realise the attainment of jhāna or ecstatic meditation (samāpatti), dispute all teachings relating to the realms of existence just described. What such sceptics should do is to practise insight meditation as taught by the Buddha. If they do they will attain jhāna that belongs to the realm of Neither Perception nor Non-perception, and realise for themselves the difference between the jhānic state in the Formless Sphere and nibbāna where such a state becomes redundant. It is futile to reject jhāna and nibbāna without any practical investigation.</p>
    
    <p>Absence of Mind and Matter in Nibbāna</p>
    <p>In nibbāna there are no such things as mind or mental concomitants, which can be met with in the sense-sphere or form-sphere. It naturally follows that mind and matter that belong to the thirty-one planes of existence are totally absent in nibbāna. However, some would like to propose that after the parinibbāna of the Buddha and the Arahants, they acquire a special kind of mind and matter in nibbāna. Such an extraordinary way of thinking may appeal to those who cannot do away with self or ego.
    </p>
 <p>   With regard to this proposition a learned Sayādaw reasoned that if there is a special kind of mind and matter in nibbāna, there must also be a special kind of rebirth which gives rise to a special kind of old age, disease, and death, which in turn bring about a special kind of sorrow, lamentation, suffering, distress, and despair. When the teachings explicitly say cessation, it will be improper to go beyond it and formulate an idea of a special kind of existence. Extinction points to nothing other than Nothingness. Nibbāna, which is not involved in mind and matter, cannot be made to get involved either in this world or in other worlds.</p>
    
<p>    Nibbāna is Beyond All Realms</p>
   <p> Hence the text says, “nāyaṃ loko, na paraloko,” which means “neither in this world nor in other worlds.” In the absence of matter there can be no concept of darkness; and in the absence of the concept of darkness, there can be no concept of light. Hence in nibbāna there is no sun nor moon. Where no new bodies of the aggregates arise there can be no darkness or light. Yet the question might arise whether it is possible for sentient beings to come to nibbāna in the way that beings from the lower realms come to the human world, or beings from the human world come to the world of devas. However, in nibbāna there are no such comings. The usual term to describe the realisation of nibbāna is that the Buddhas and Arahants “enter” nibbāna, or specifically, anupādisesanibbāna. This does not mean the arrival of new aggregates, but the cutting off of the flow of mind and matter that causes existence. It is the complete extinction of aggregates; and this extinction is recognised as anupādisesanibbāna. It is not a place where beings make their landing from other planes of existence.
  </p>
  <p>  No one goes out or gets transported from nibbāna to other planes of existence either. Beings with wholesome kammas depart this human world for the world of devas; and those from heaven might also come down to earth as human beings. Those with unwholesome kammas might prefer going down to the lower realms. In nibbāna there is no such coming and going.</p>

    <p>Attributes of Nibbāna</p>
   <p> 
    Nibbāna Has No Mass</p>
   <p> It is often asked whether the Buddhas and Arahants exist as individuals in nibbāna. There is no mass in nibbāna. As it is not built up with a special kind of matter or mind, it cannot be looked upon as a mountain peopled by individuals, standing solidly across the firmament, like heaven or earth.</p>
    
   <p> Nibbāna is Deathless and Birthless</p>
    <p>In the thirty-one planes of existence one is born to die and be reborn to die again. Nibbāna is deathless and birthless. In the world of devas and brahmas, birth means sudden appearance, and death means sudden disappearance. Nibbāna is the cessation of all aggregates. In such a cessation there is neither appearance nor disappearance.</p>

 <p>   Nibbāna Offers No Sense-objects</p>
    
 <p>In the absence of mind, matter, consciousness, concomitants, etc., There can be no sense-objects, and in the absence of sense-objects no opportunities arise for mental formations to play their part. Nibbāna means the end of suffering. Since there are no primary elements and no mind and matter, everything ceases, and this cessation means eternal peace. All sufferings end.</p>

<p>Compare Yogacara:</p>

<p>

"The Yogacara (sometimes translated as “Mind only”) school of Buddhist philosophy contends that all human experience is constructed by mind. Some later representatives of one Yogacara subschool (Prajnakaragupta, Ratnakīrti) propounded a form of idealism that has been interpreted as solipsism. A view of this sort is contained in the 11th-century treatise of Ratnakirti, “Refutation of the existence of other minds” (Santanantara dusana), which provides a philosophical refutation of external mind-streams from the Buddhist standpoint of ultimate truth (as distinct from the perspective of everyday reality)."

  <p>"One of the main features of Yogācāra philosophy is the concept of vijñapti-mātra. It is often used interchangeably with the term citta-mātra in modern and ancient Yogacara sources. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." ... 
    Regarding existing Sanskrit sources, the term appears in the first verse of Vasubandhu’s Vimśatikā, which is a locus classicus of the idea, it states:[16]
  
  Vijñaptimātram evaitad asad arthāvabhāsanāt yathā taimirikasyāsat keśa candrādi darśanam. “This [world] is vijñaptimātra, since it manifests itself as an unreal object (artha), just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.”
  
  According to Mark Siderits, what Vasubandhu means here is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but “there is actually no such thing outside the mind.”[16]
  
  The term also appears in Asaṅga’s classic Yogācāra work, the Mahāyānasaṃgraha (no Sanskrit original, trans. from Tibetan):
  
  These representations (vijñapti) are mere representations (vijñapti-mātra), because there is no [corresponding] thing/object (artha)…Just as in a dream there appear, even without a thing/object (artha), just in the mind alone, forms/images of all kinds of things/objects like visibles, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, houses, forests, land, and mountains, and yet there are no [such] things/objects at all in that [place]. MSg II.6[17]
  
  The term is sometimes used as a synonym with citta-mātra (mere citta), which is also used as a name for the school that suggests Idealism.[4][18] Schmithausen writes that the first appearance of this term is in the Pratyupanna samadhi sutra, which states:
  
  This (or: whatever belongs to this) triple world (traidhātuka) is nothing but mind (or thought: cittamatra). Why? Because however I imagine things, that is how they appear.[19]"
  -Wikipedia on Yogacara</p>
  
  <p>"Scholars such as Saam Trivedi argue that Yogācāra is similar to Idealism (closer to a Kantian epistemic idealism), though they note that it is its own unique form and that it might be confusing to categorize it as such.[21] Paul Williams, citing Griffiths, writes that it could be termed “dynamic idealism”.[22] Sean Butler argues for the idealistic nature of Yogācāra, noting that there are numerous similarities between Yogācāra and the systems of Kant and Berkeley.[23] Jay Garfield also argues that Yogācāra is “akin to the idealisms defended by such Western philosophers as Berkeley, Kant and Schopenhauer.”[24]
  
  Jonathan Gold writes that the Yogācāra thinker Vasubandhu can be said to be an idealist (similar to Kant), in the sense that for him, everything in experience as well as its causal support is mental, and thus he gives causal priority to the mental."
  -Wikipedia on Yogacara</p>
  
  <p>"The Vaibhāṣika’s realistic theory of the two truths and the Sautrāntika’s representationalist theory of the two truths both affirm the ultimate reality of physical objects constituted by atoms. The Yogācāra rejects physical realism of both the Vaibhāṣika and the Sautrāntika, although it agrees with the Sautrāntika’s representationalist theory as far as they both affirm representation as the intentional objects in perception and deny in perception a direct access to any external object. Where they part their company is in their response to the questions: what causes representations? Is the contact of senses with physical objects necessary to give rise to representations in perception? The Sautrāntika’s reply is that external objects cause representations, given that these representations are intentional objects there is indeed a contact between senses and external objects. This affirmative response allows the Sautrāntika to affirm reality of external objects. The Yogācārin however replies that “subliminal impressions” (vāsanās) from foundational consciousness (ālayavijñāna) are the causes of the mental representations, and given that these impressions are only internal phenomena acting as intentional objects, the contact between senses and external objects is therefore rejected even conventionally. This allows the Yogācārin to deny even conventional reality of all physical objects, and argue that all conventional realities are our mental representations, mental creations, cognitions etc.
  
  The central thesis in the Yogācāra philosophy, the theory of the two truths echoes is the assertion that all that is conventionally real is only ideas, representations, images, creations of the mind, and that there is no conventionally real object that exists outside the mind to which it corresponds. These ideas are only objects of any cognition. The whole universe is a mental universe. All physical objects are only fiction, they are unreal even by the conventional standard, similar to a dream, a mirage, a magical illusion, where what we perceive are only products of our mind, without a real external existence.
  
  Inspired by the idealistic tendencies of various sūtras consisting of important elements of the idealistic doctrines, in the third and the fourth centuries many Indian philosophers developed and systematised a coherent Idealist School. In the beginning of the Viṃśatikā Vasubandhu treats citta, manas, vijñāna, vijñāpti as synonymous and uses these terms as the names of the idealistic school. The chief founders were Maitreyanāth (ca. 300) and Asaṅga (315–390), propagated by Vasubandhu (320–380), Dignāga (480–540) Sthiramati (ca. 500), Dharmapāla (530–561), Hiuan-tsang (602–664), Dharmakīrti (600–660), Śāntarakṣita (ca.725–788) and Kamalaśīla (ca.740–795). The last two are Yogācāra-Mādhyamikas in contrast with the earlier figures who are identified as Yogācārins."
  
  -Thakchoe, Sonam, “The Theory of Two Truths in India”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</p>

  <p>The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra often presents a mind-only philosophy influenced by the idealistic thought of the Yogacara school. According to the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra "all things are only manifestations of the mind itself" i.e. all phenomena are "mind-only" (cittamātra) or "ideation-only" (vijñaptimatra).[14] This idealistic view is explained by the Lanka as the view that "what is seen as something external is nothing but one's own mind" (svacitta-drsya-mātram). ... In turn, the view that the world and phenomena exist "externally", outside of mind, is seen as a serious error that leads to delusion and suffering. The Lanka sutra specifically cites the dualistic view of Samkhya philosophy for criticism."
    -Wikipedia page on The Lankavatara Sutra
  </p>

  <p>Samkhya philosophy, which is sometimes seen as the basis of Yogic thought, adopts a view that matter exists independently of individual minds. Representation of an object in an individual mind is held to be a mental approximation of the object in the external world. Therefore, Samkhya chooses representational realism over epistemological solipsism. Having established this distinction between the external world and the mind, Samkhya posits the existence of two metaphysical realities Prakriti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness)."
    -Wikipedia page on Solipsism

    <p>Another notable fact is that while many think of Hinduism as being idealism, this is actually a gross oversimplification. In reality only certain schools teach idealism, while many others are realist. For example, of the six orthodox Hindu schools, Samkya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta, only one, Vedanta, is idealism, and only certain versions of it. For example, Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta was realist and argued against idealism, as did Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta, while Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta is the one known for being idealist. The reason is probably that Advaita philosophy became very popular outside of India, and many falsely believe that it represents Hinduism as a whole.</p>

    <p>Further, some schools of Hinduism were actually non-theist, or even atheist:</p>

    <p>"Arguments against existence of God in Hindu philosophy</p>

    <p>
      "Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. Mimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals.[27] They further thought that the Gods named in the Vedas had no physical existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods.[28] Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas."</p>
      
      <p>Samkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:
      
      <uo>
        <li>If the existence of karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.</li>

     <li> Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.</li>

  <li>    Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
    Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.</li>
