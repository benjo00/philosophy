  <div class="vasu">Vasubandhu, an early proponent of a kind of idealism known as Yogacara</div>
    <p>Idealism seems like a lot of fun. Nothing is real! It's all in your mind! Neat! But, any rational person can see some serious flaws, here. First, go ahead and try to change something. Seriously, imagine billions of dollars worth of gold coins into your closet. Now, check your closet. Any coins? Try imagining food into your stomach. Did it work? Didn't think so. And of course we could do infinite experiments like that, and not one would work, except some absurdly small things, like quantum level events. But those require interpretation, and are too small to actually see anyway. If you can't actually directly sense it in the first place, and are relying on many levels of inference, you can't make a broad claim that it disproves all commonsense reality, and this type of thing would self refute anyway, as can be seen demonstrated in the <a href="./commonSense.html">Common Sense</a> page. Further, keep in mind that for every interpretation that claims quantum mechanics proves some idealism type idea, there is an interpretation that completely contradicts this notion, and plants physics right back on solid ground. For an example, see Rodney Brooks "Fields of Color."</p>

    <p>Now, there are many kinds of idealism, but fundamental to all of them is they deny a significant amount of reality to the objective world, or even all of it, and they cast a huge doubt, or entirely refute the senses. None of this works, because if nothing is real, then the poisiton "nothing is real" cannot be real. If your senses and mind are completely unreliable, since they are founded on the commonsense understanding of the world, in which objects exist outside of mind, and that understanding is completely false, then your position falls apart.</p>

    <p>Wittgenstein put it thusly:
      "We can’t doubt anything without exempting certain other things from doubt. Thus the basic position is that even philosophical doubt requires non-doubt (or belief). That is, in order to get the game of doubt underway, certain things must be placed beyond doubt."
    </p>

    <p>In other words, some things MUST be real, or else you have no position whatsoever. For all intents and purposes, the commonsense world built by your mind and senses, being the bare minimum and what all is built on, must be real, and providing real, reliable data. If they are not, then any information built by, or learned by them must also be invalid.</p>

    <p>While idealists will argue with this, when we really look at it broadly, all idealism falls under a kind of solipsism category (nothinge exists but your own mind) if we follow the logic far enough. For example, the Yogacara in some iterations were not solipsist, since they acknowledged other minds, while denying all objective reality. Yet, follow that thought all the way down, and we see, quite quickly, that if a table doesn't exist outside your own mind, and neither does your own body, nor the body of a person you are talking to, there is no rational reason to believe that the other person's mind exists, either. Thus, deny the commonsense world, and reify the mind, and you fall into solipsism pretty quickly (note: the Pyrrhonists solved this by casting doubt on the mind, too, but they fall into a different trap. See the page on <a href=./simple-spaghetti.html>Extreme Skepticism</a>). Yet, this is the same problem as all idealism: if nothing is real, because all is mind, then the positions "nothing is real but the mind" is also imaginary, and unreal. Further, it has been demonstrated conclusively that solipsism is completely incoherent:</p>

    <p><p>"The Incoherence of Solipsism</p>

      With the belief in the essential privacy of experience eliminated as false, the last presupposition underlying solipsism is removed and solipsism is shown as foundationless, in theory and in fact. One might even say, solipsism is necessarily foundationless, for to make an appeal to logical rules or empirical evidence the solipsist would implicitly have to affirm the very thing that he purportedly refuses to believe: the reality of intersubjectively valid criteria and a public, extra-mental world. There is a temptation to say that solipsism is a false philosophical theory, but this is not quite strong or accurate enough. As a theory, it is incoherent. What makes it incoherent, above all else, is that the solipsist requires a language (that is, a sign-system) to think or to affirm his solipsistic thoughts at all.
      
      Given this, it is scarcely surprising that those philosophers who accept the Cartesian premises that make solipsism apparently plausible, if not inescapable, have also invariably assumed that language-usage is itself essentially private. The cluster of arguments—generally referred to as “the private language argument”—that we find in the Investigations against this assumption effectively administers the coup de grâce to both Cartesian dualism and solipsism. (I. § 202; 242-315). Language is an irreducibly public form of life that is encountered in specifically social contexts. Each natural language-system contains an indefinitely large number of “language-games,” governed by rules that, though conventional, are not arbitrary personal fiats. The meaning of a word is its (publicly accessible) use in a language. To question, argue, or doubt is to utilize language in a particular way. It is to play a particular kind of public language-game. The proposition “I am the only mind that exists” makes sense only to the extent that it is expressed in a public language, and the existence of such language itself implies the existence of a social context. Such a context exists for the hypothetical last survivor of a nuclear holocaust, but not for the solipsist. A non-linguistic solipsism is unthinkable and a thinkable solipsism is necessarily linguistic. Solipsism therefore presupposes the very thing that it seeks to deny. That solipsistic thoughts are thinkable in the first instance implies the existence of the public, shared, intersubjective world that they purport to call into question."
      
      -Stephen P. Thornton</p>

      <p>Des Cartes made the famous statement "I think, therefore I am." This ostensibly props up and reifies the mind, while casting doubt on the senses, and their data. Yet, we have the exact same amount of information to confirm the mind as we do the sense data. We percieve a thought, and if merely percieving a thought affirms the reality of the mind, then percieving an object surely confirms the reality of the object. This is likely why the Buddhists categorized the mind as one of the senses. Thus, a fuller, more accurate thought on the matter should be "I think, therefore the percieved thought of "I" is, and I see, hear, taste, smell, and touch things, therefore those things percieved, also, are." Hence, the Cartesian position, fully, and properly extrapolated, must confirm commonsense reality, and casts no doubt whatsoever.</p>

<p>Idealism is not a valid position.</p>

    <p>Sure, some will infinitely eel wriggle around and try to argue versions of quasi idealism that are somehow ostensibly valid, despite these fatal flaws. But, if they are so light on idealism as to allow commonsense reality to stand, then they are not really idealism. If they are too far over the line so as to contradict commonsense reality, then they are invalid. there is no grey area.</p>

    <p>For a thorough example of how and why the commonsense world can never be entirely refuted in a valid philosophy, and what the alternatives are, please see the <a href=./commonSense.html>Common Sense</a> page.</p> 

<p>In a very strange twist of fate, this position was articulated brilliantly by a relativist philosopher named "Tsong Khapa" over five hundred years ago, thusly:

  "[l]f there were no place for conventional phenomena, the existence of which is established by the epistemic instruments, these phenomena would be like the snake - that is,
  the rope grasped as a snake - of which no cause or effect is possible. . . .
  [l]f one were forced to maintain that there is no place for bondage, liberation, etc in the
  meaning of “conventional existence/’ and that these must be placed only in the erroneous perspective, that would be a great philosophical error.
  Even worse, as long as convention is conceived [as entirely nonexistent], since there
  would be no role for the epistemic instruments, neither the proposition maintained nor
  the person who maintains it nor the proof - including scriptural sources and reasoning - could be established by epistemic instruments. So it would be ridiculous to maintain
  that there are no genuine phenomena delivered by the epistemic instruments.” {Ocean
  30-31 )15
  
  Tsong khapa makes it plain here that conventional phenomena, unlike the snake
  thought to be perceived when one sees a rope, have causes and effects, and are
  actual. Moreover, he argues that the repudiation of the reality of the conventional
  would undermine the possibility of epistemic authority, undermining even the abil-
  ity to argue cogently that the conventional does not exist. Such a position would
  be self-refuting.
  -Jay Garfield, Taking Conventional Truth Seriously"
</p>

<p>The bizarre thing is that this philosopher was part of a school, known as Madhyamaka, that frequently argued against a lot of down to earth, commonsense worldviews. The thing is, though, they had two positions: 
  <ol>
    <li>The ultimate reality, which is where they argued against the existence of literally everything, including their own positions, and they were well aware of this, and openly admitted exactly this regularly.</li>
    <li>Conventional reality (aka commonsense reality), which is what I've been talking about throughout. </li></ol>
    
  <p>This philosophy school, paradoxically, fiercely defended BOTH positions. In fact, one of the most brilliant thinkers in history, Chandrakirti, was from this school, and wrote an excellent refutation of idealism, while at the same time maintaining the ultimate non existence of everything. Here is Chandrakirti on the matter:</p>
  
  <p>" The word “only” has no capacity to negate the objective component of knowledge (jneya). ...

    “…the Lankavatara sutra substitutes “mind alone” for “mind alone is preeminent in the context of everyday experience.” The meaning of this scripture is not to be understood as a negation of form.”
    
    …When the scripture says “mind alone exists; form does not,” this is taught to deny the importance of form and so forth, not to negate their very existence…
    
    If he intended to deny the existence of objective reality wen he said that [the world] is mind alone, then why would the mahatma declare, in the same text, that mind is produced from delusion (moha) and volitional action (karman)?
    
    What sensible person would look at a passage from this same [Dasabhumikasutra] and imagine that consciousness exists as an independent thing (vastutah)? A notion like this is nothing more than dogmatic opinion. It follows that the expression “mind only” serves only to clarify that mind is the most significant element [in experience] This text should not be understood to assert that there is no objective form (rupa).... One can certainly maintain that objective form exists. ... [Refutation of a noncognized entity (reflexive awareness) as the ultimate truth]

    If this “dependent entity” exists in the absence of both subject and object, then who is aware of its existence? It would be unacceptable to assert that it exists unapprehended.
    
    It is not proven that [a cognition] is aware of itself. Nor can this be proven by using the subsequent memory [of a previous event as evidence], for in this case the thesis intended to substantiate your claim itself embodies an unproven premise, and therefore it cannot be admitted [as valid proof].
    
    Therefore, without [this notion of] reflexive awareness who (or what) will apprehend your dependent [form]? The actor, the object [of the action], and the action are not identical, and for this reason it is illogical to maintain that [a cognition] apprehends itself.
    
    However, if the entity which is [a manifestation of this] dependent form (paratantrarupavastu) exists without ever having been produced or cognized, then why should our opponent insist that [belief in] the son of a barren woman is irrational? What harm could the son of a barren woman inflict on him [that he has not already suffered through belief in his concept of dependent form]?
    
     And in the event that this dependent [form] in no way whatsoever exists, then what will function as the cause for the screen [of conventional truth]? All the ordered structure of everyday experience is laid waste by this clinging to a real substance inherent in our opponents philosophical views. ... Conventional truth is the means, the truth of the highest meaning is the goal, and one who does not appreciate the distinction between these two treads a wrong path through his reified concepts. We [Madhyamikas] do not have the same attitude toward our [concept of] the screen as you [Yogacarins] have toward your [concept of] dependent being (paratantrabhava). With reference to the nature of everyday experience, we say: “Even though things do not exist, they exist” - and this is done for a specified purpose.

  [The things of the world] do not exist for the saints who have abandoned the pyschophysical aggregates and found peace. If, in a similar manner, they did not exist in the context of everyday experience, then we would not maintain that they do - even in this qualified sense.
    
  If everyday experience poses no threat to you, then you may persist in this denial of the evidence provided by such experience. Quarrel with the evidence of everyday experience, and afterward we will rely on the winner.""
-Chandrakirti, translated by C. W. Huntington, The Emptiness of Emptiness</p>
  
  The members of this school saw no conflict in defending both positions, yet, Kumarila Bhatta, also known for his genius and refutation of Buddhist idealism, who was of the Mimamsa school (a very interesting sect of Hinduism, look it up!) certainly noticed, as can be seen by his words on the matter of the Madhyamaka philosophy:</p>

<p><p>"Mīmāṃsā refutation of Two Truths Doctrine</p>
  Chattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century Mīmāṃsā philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa rejected the Two Truths Doctrine in his Shlokavartika. Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval Buddhist rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India[61] since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that "the theory of the nothingness of the objective world" is absurd: Kumārila Bhaṭṭa:
  
  "The idealist talks of some 'apparent truth' or 'provisional truth of practical life', i.e. in his terminology, of samvriti satya. However, since in his own view, there is really no truth in this 'apparent truth', what is the sense of asking us to look at it as some special brand of truth as it were? If there is truth in it, why call it false at all? And, if it is really false, why call it a kind of truth? Truth and falsehood, being mutually exclusive, there cannot be any factor called 'truth' as belonging in common to both--no more than there can by any common factor called 'treeness' belonging to both the tree and the lion, which are mutually exclusive. On the idealist's own assumption, this 'apparent truth' is nothing but a synonym for the 'false'. Why, then, does he use this expression? Because it serves for him a very important purpose. It is the purpose of a verbal hoax. It means falsity, though with such a pedantic air about it as to suggest something apparently different, as it were. This is in fact a well known trick. Thus, to create a pedantic air, one can use the word vaktrasava [literally mouth-wine] instead of the simpler word lala, meaning saliva [vancanartha upanyaso lala-vaktrasavadivat]. But why is this pedantic air? Why, instead of simply talking of falsity, is the verbal hoax of an 'apparent truth' or samvriti? The purpose of conceiving this samvriti is only to conceal the absurdity of the theory of the nothingness of the objective world, so that it can somehow be explained why things are imagined as actually existing when they are not so. Instead of playing such verbal tricks, therefore, one should speak honestly. This means: one should admit that what does not exist, exists not; and what does exist, exists in the full sense. The latter alone is true, and the former false. But the idealist just cannot afford to do this. He is obliged instead to talk of 'two truths', senseless though this be."

  <p>Ande here he is on Yogacara idealism specifically:</p>

</p>The Thesis Is Self-Undermining
For Kumārila, not only is the Thesis called into question by perceptual and inferential counterevidence, but it also undermines itself in three different ways.
• No Difference Between Qualificand and Qualifier. First, the conclusion of any
argument makes sense only insofar as it involves two components. The first
is a qualificand (viśes.
ya), i.e., the site. In the Buddhist argument, the qualificand is the awareness of a pillar, etc… The second is a qualifier (viśes.an. a),
i.e., the target property that is inferred. In this case, it is supportlessness. But
if there are no distinct objects apprehended by awareness-events apart from
themselves or their aspects, then there can’t be any distinction between the
qualificand and the qualifier (v. 35)</p>

<p>Impossibility of Communication. The awareness of the qualificand and the
  qualifier, which arises in both the speaker and the hearer, doesn’t apprehend
  anything distinct from it. But the view that is being conveyed by the Thesis itself can only be known only if there are such objects. So, the Buddhist
  who puts forward this thesis is caught in a pragmatic contradiction: they assert something which, if true, cannot be known (and therefore shouldn’t be
  asserted) (v. 36).
  • Impossibility of Truth/Accuracy. Finally, if all awareness-events lack an objective support, then it’s impossible to undergo any true or accurate awareness
  at all (since truth, intuitively, involves some kind of correspondence with an
  independent reality). Various bad consequences will then follow.
  </p>
<p>The awareness as of the reason being present in the site is either true
or false. If it is false, then the view can’t be proved on that basis (vv.
74cd-75cd). If the awareness is true, then it is made true by some apprehended objects, i.e., by the site and its possessing awareness-hood.
So, at least, some awareness-events have to have an external objective
support (v. 75cd).
The Buddhist’s own awareness that awareness-events exist, and are distinct and momentary, must either be true or false. If it is true, that
awareness-event must have an external objective support, so the Buddhist’s argument fails. If it is false, the Buddhist can’t take their Thesis to
be true (since it presupposes or entails the existence of such awarenessevents) (vv. 81cd-82).
Finally, if the Thesis is qualified so that it only says that all awarenessevents other than the awareness-events about the site, the target property, or the reason, lack objective support, then we could still end up
with the conclusion that these awareness-events have an external objective support. But since they aren’t fundamentally different from other
waking awareness-events, we wouldn’t be able to rule out the possibility that those awareness-events also have an external objective support
(v. 76).
Upshot: the Thesis is self-undermining.
-Kumarila Bhatta, verses 35-76
</p>

<p>Here we see Ramanuja making a similar critique of Yogacara idealism:</p>

<p>To maintain, as the Yogâkâras do, that the general rule of idea and thing presenting themselves together proves the non-difference of the thing from the idea, implies a self-contradiction; for ‘going together’ can only be where there are different things. To hold that it is a general rule that of the idea—the essential nature of which is to make the thing to which it refers capable of entering into common thought and intercourse—we are always conscious together with the thing, and then to prove therefrom that the thing is not different from the idea, is a laughable proceeding indeed.
  -Ramanuja, Vedanta sutra 2.2.28-2.2.31
</p>


 

  <p>Regardless, we might take the arguments in a vaccuum, and separate the commonsense defense, and keep the truth in it for our purposes. Certainly, because the other arguments self refute entirely (see Stafford L. Betty's works on Nagarjuna for more on this), leaving only the defense of common sense as valid.</p>

  <p>A well known modern argument for common sense is G. E. Moore's "A Defense of Common Sense." Here is a selection: </p>

  <p>All the four expressions I have just introduced, namely, “Material things are not real,” “Space is not real,” “Time is not real,” “The Self is not real,” are, I think, unlike the expressions I used in (1), really ambiguous. And it may be that, in the case of each of them, some philosopher has used the expression in question to express some view he held which was not incompatible with (2). With such philosophers, if there are any, I am not, of course, at present concerned. But it seems to me that the most natural and proper usage of each of these expressions is a usage in which it does express a view incompatible with (2); and, in the case of each of them, some philosophers have, I think, really used the expression in question to express such a view. All such philosophers have, therefore, been holding a view incompatible with (2).

    All such views, whether incompatible with all of the propositions in (1), or only with some of them, seems to me to be quite certainly false; and I think the following points are specially deserving of notice with regard to them:
    
    (a) If any of the classes of propositions in (2) is such that no proposition of that class is true, then no philosopher has ever existed, and therefore none can ever have held with regard to any such class, that no proposition belonging to it is true. In other words, the proposition that some propositions belonging to each of these classes are true is a proposition which has the peculiarity, that, if any philosopher has ever denied it, it follows from the fact that he has denied it, that he must have been wrong in denying it. For when I speak of “philosophers” I mean, of course (as we all do), exclusively philosophers who have been human beings, with human bodies that have lived upon the earth, and who have at different times had many different experiences. If, therefore, there have been any philosophers, there have been human beings of this class; and if there have been human beings of this class, all the rest of what is asserted in (1) is certainly true too. Any view, therefore, incompatible with the proposition that many propositions corresponding to each of the propositions in (1) are true, can only be true, on the hypothesis that no philosopher has ever held any such view. It follows, therefore, that, in considering whether this proposition is true, I cannot consistently regard the fact that many philosophers, whom I respect, have, to the best of my belief, held views incompatible with it, as having any weight at all against it. Since, if I know that they have held such views, I am, ipso facto, knowing that they were mistaken; and, if I have no reason to believe that the proposition in question is true, I have still less reason to believe that they have held views incompatible with it; since I am more certain that they have existed and held some views, i.e. that the proposition in question is true, than that they have held any views incompatible with it.
    …
    If this first point in my philosophical position, namely my belief in (2), is to be given any name, which has actually been used by philosophers in classifying the positions of other philosophers, it would have, I think, to be expressed by saying that I am one of those philosophers who have held that the “Common Sense view of the world” is, in certain fundamental features, wholly true. But it must be remembered that, according to me, all philosophers, without exception, have agreed with me in holding this: and that the real difference, which is commonly expressed in this way, is only a difference between those philosophers, who have also held views inconsistent with these features in “the Common Sense view of the world,” and those who have not.
    
    The features in question (namely, propositions of any of the classes defined in defining (2)) are all of them features, which have this peculiar property – namely, that if we know that they are features in the “Common Sense view of the world,” it follows that they are true: it is self-contradictory to maintain that we know them to be features in the Common Sense view, and that yet they are not true; since to say that we know this, is to say that they are true. And many of them also have the further peculiar property that, if they are features in the Common Sense view of the world (whether “we” know this or not), it follows that they are true, since to say that there is a “Common Sense view of the world,” is to say that they are true. The phrases “Common Sense view of the world” or “Common Sense beliefs” (as used by philosophers) are, of course, extraordinarily vague; and, for all I know, there may be many propositions which may be properly called features in “the Common Sense view of the world” or “Common Sense beliefs,” which are not true, and which deserve to be mentioned with the contempt with which some philosophers speak of “Common Sense beliefs.” But to speak with contempt of those “Common Sense beliefs” which I have mentioned is quite certainly the height of absurdity. And there are, of course, enormous numbers of other features in “the Common Sense view of the world” which, if these are true, are quite certainly true too: e.g. that there have lived upon the surface of the earth not only human beings, but also many different species of plants and animals, etc. etc.
    
    -A Defense of Common Sense, G. E. Moore</p>

    <p>This is an amusing talk about the power of the common sense world against an idealist by Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher:</p>

    <p>If I were a slave of one of these gentlemen, even at the risk of being whipped to the bone every day, I would never stop tormenting him.
    <p>  ‘Throw a bit of oil into the bath, boy.’</p>
     <p> I’d take some fish sauce and go and pour it over his head.</p>
    <p>    ‘What’s this?’</p>
      <p>‘ I had an impression that was indistinguishable from that of oil; it was just the same, I swear that by your fortune.’</p>
    <p>  ‘ Here pass me the gruel.’</p>
     <p> I’d bring him a dish full of vinegar.</p>
    <p>  ‘Didn’t I ask you for the gruel?’</p>
      <p>‘ Yes, master, this is gruel.’</p>
    <p>  ‘ But surely it’s vinegar?’</p>
 <p>     ‘ Why that rather than gruel?’</p>
    <p>  ‘Take some and smell it, take some and taste it.’</p>
  <p>    ‘ Well, how do you know, if it is true that our senses deceive us?’</p>
    <p>  If I had three or four fellow slaves who thought in the same way as I did, I’d soon make him explode with anger ... or else change his ideas.
      But as things are, men like this are making fun of us, they make use of all the gifts of nature while abolishing them in theory.
      -Discourses: 2:20</p>

  <p>As an interesting aside, while Buddhism is known for its later iterations in the shape of Madhyamaka relativism and Yogacara idealism, the earlier form of Buddhism, Theravada, was overtly realist, as can be seen by the following:</p>

  <p>“If, friends, internally the eye is intact but no external forms come into its range, and there is no corresponding conscious engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness. If internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its range, but there is no corresponding conscious engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness."
    -Majjhima Nikaya 28</p>
    
    <p>“Bhikkhus, consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad. And how, bhikkhus, does consciousness come to be in dependence on a dyad? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness."
      -Samyutta Nikaya 35.93</p>
    
   <p> "A given instance of perceptual consciousness is said to arise only in dependence upon two conditions: the sense organ and its corresponding object-field. This implies that perceptual consciousness arises only in conjunction with an appropriate and existent object; perceptual consciousness of a nonexistent object or without an object is, therefore, impossible."

   <p> “And what is it, bhikkhus, that the wise in the world agree upon as existing, of which I too say that it exists? Form that is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this the wise in the world agree upon as existing, and I too say that it exists."
    -Samyutta Nikaya 22.94</p>
  
    <p>"If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.""
