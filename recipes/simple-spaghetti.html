    <p>Extreme skepticism is the belief that we cannot know anything whatsoever. This belief self refutes, because, if you can't know anything, then you cannot know the position of not knowing anything, either. More mild skepticism, is, of course, exempt from this self refutation. We can, and certainly should be skeptical about some things. However being extremely skeptical about all things is invalid.</p>

    <p>This may, however, be a valid position if one doesn't try to explain it. For example, there is a huge difference between shrugging when asked about one's position, indicating one hasn't one, and actually saying, "I believe nothing." It's one thing to not know something, and skirt the language trap of philosophy, and it's another thing to attempt to prove that you believe nothing, as that self refutes. Nonetheless, the Ajnana figured out a way to articulate this in a such a manner as to possibly not self refute, so long as we don't go beyond the use of the response given by the Ajnana on the <a href ="./commonSense.html">Common Sense</a> page. </p>

    <p>Further, wordless skepticism, as in having no position whatsoever, and simply living life without considering what one knows is debatably another valid version of extreme skepticism. Yet, again, it is not articulated, and so does not self refute. One might notice that people like Chuang Tzu, or some of the Zen masters had this position of valid skepticism at times. Sometimes they would answer questions with nonsense, or recommendations to simply live in the moment, state that they don't have an answer, and similar. For example:</p>

    <p>"A monk told Joshu, "I have just entered this monastery. I beg you to teach me." Joshu asked, "Have you eaten your rice porridge?" The monk replied, "I have." "Then," said Joshu, "Go and wash your bowl."
        At that moment the monk was enlightened."

    <p>"Knowledge strolled north to the shores of the
        Dark Waters, scaled the mount of Secret Heights and came
        upon Words-of-Actionless-Action. Knowledge said to
        Words-of-Actionless-Action, ‘I want to ask you something.
        What sort of thought and reflection does it take to knowthe Tao? In what sort of place and in what sorts of ways
        should we undertake to rest in the Tao? What sort of path
        and what sort of plans do we need to obtain the Tao?’ These
        three questions he asked of Words-of-Actionless-Action,
        but he did not answer. Not only did he not answer, he had no
        idea what to answer.
        Knowledge did not obtain any answers, so he travelled to
        the White Waters of the south, climbed up on to the top of
        Doubt Curtailed and there caught sight of Wild-and-Surly.
        Knowledge put the same question to Wild-and-Surly. Wildand-Surly said, ‘Ah ha! I know, and I will tell you.’ In the
middle of saying this, he forgot what he was going to say!
Knowledge did not obtain any answers, so he went back
to the Emperor’s palace to see the Yellow Emperor and to
ask him. The Yellow Emperor said, ‘Practise having no
thoughts and no reflections and you will come to know the
Tao. Only when you have no place and can see no way
forward will you find rest in the Tao. Have no path and no
plans and you will obtain the Tao.’
Knowledge said to the Yellow Emperor, ‘You and I know this, but the others did not know, so which of us is actually
right?’
The Yellow Emperor said, ‘Words-of-Actionless-Action
was truly right. Wild-and-Surly seems right. In the end, you
and I are not close to it.
‘Those who understand, do not say.
Those who say, do not understand.
And so the sage follows the teachings
without words.
The Tao cannot be made to occur,
Virtue cannot be sought after.
However, benevolence can be undertaken,
righteousness can be striven for,
rituals can be adhered to.
It is said, “When the Tao was lost, Virtue
appeared;
when Virtue was lost, benevolence appeared;
when benevolence was lost, righteousness
appeared;
when righteousness was lost, ritual appeared.
Rituals are just the frills on the hem of the
Tao, and are signs of impending disorder.”
‘It is said, “One who follows the Tao daily does less and
less. As he does less and less, he eventually arrives at
actionless action. Having achieved actionless action, there
is nothing which is not done.” Now that we have become
active, if we wish to return to our original state, we will find it very difficult! Who but the great man could change
this?"
