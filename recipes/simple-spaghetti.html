    <div class="pyrText">Pyrrho, a well known skeptic</div>

    <p>Extreme skepticism is the belief that we cannot know anything whatsoever. This belief self refutes, because, if you can't know anything, then you cannot know the position of not knowing anything, either. More mild skepticism, is, of course, exempt from this self refutation. We can, and certainly should be skeptical about some things. However being extremely skeptical about all things is invalid.</p>

    <p>This may, however, be a valid position if one doesn't try to explain it. For example, there is a huge difference between shrugging when asked about one's position, indicating one hasn't one, and actually saying, "I believe nothing." It's one thing to not know something, and skirt the language trap of philosophy, and it's another thing to attempt to prove that you believe nothing, as that self refutes. Nonetheless, the Ajnana figured out a way to articulate this in a such a manner as to possibly not self refute, so long as we don't go beyond the use of the response given by the Ajnana on the <a href ="./commonSense.html">Common Sense</a> page. </p>

    <p>Further, wordless skepticism, as in having no position whatsoever, and simply living life without considering what one knows is debatably another valid version of extreme skepticism. Yet, again, it is not articulated, and so does not self refute. One might notice that people like Chuang Tzu, or some of the Zen masters had this position of valid skepticism at times. Sometimes they would answer questions with nonsense, or recommendations to simply live in the moment, state that they don't have an answer, and similar. Perhaps this is the proper way to understand things, rather, by not understanding! For example:</p>

    <p>"A monk told Joshu, "I have just entered this monastery. I beg you to teach me." Joshu asked, "Have you eaten your rice porridge?" The monk replied, "I have." "Then," said Joshu, "Go and wash your bowl."
        At that moment the monk was enlightened."

    <p>"Knowledge strolled north to the shores of the
        Dark Waters, scaled the mount of Secret Heights and came
        upon Words-of-Actionless-Action. Knowledge said to
        Words-of-Actionless-Action, ‘I want to ask you something.
        What sort of thought and reflection does it take to know the Tao? In what sort of place and in what sorts of ways
        should we undertake to rest in the Tao? What sort of path
        and what sort of plans do we need to obtain the Tao?’ These
        three questions he asked of Words-of-Actionless-Action,
        but he did not answer. Not only did he not answer, he had no
        idea what to answer.
        Knowledge did not obtain any answers, so he travelled to
        the White Waters of the south, climbed up on to the top of
        Doubt Curtailed and there caught sight of Wild-and-Surly.
        Knowledge put the same question to Wild-and-Surly. Wild and-Surly said, ‘Ah ha! I know, and I will tell you.’ In the
middle of saying this, he forgot what he was going to say!
Knowledge did not obtain any answers, so he went back
to the Emperor’s palace to see the Yellow Emperor and to
ask him. The Yellow Emperor said, ‘Practise having no
thoughts and no reflections and you will come to know the
Tao. Only when you have no place and can see no way
forward will you find rest in the Tao. Have no path and no
plans and you will obtain the Tao.’
Knowledge said to the Yellow Emperor, ‘You and I know this, but the others did not know, so which of us is actually
right?’
The Yellow Emperor said, ‘Words-of-Actionless-Action
was truly right. Wild-and-Surly seems right. In the end, you
and I are not close to it.
‘Those who understand, do not say.
Those who say, do not understand.
And so the sage follows the teachings
without words.
The Tao cannot be made to occur,
Virtue cannot be sought after.
However, benevolence can be undertaken,
righteousness can be striven for,
rituals can be adhered to.
It is said, “When the Tao was lost, Virtue
appeared;
when Virtue was lost, benevolence appeared;
when benevolence was lost, righteousness
appeared;
when righteousness was lost, ritual appeared.
Rituals are just the frills on the hem of the
Tao, and are signs of impending disorder.”
‘It is said, “One who follows the Tao daily does less and
less. As he does less and less, he eventually arrives at
actionless action. Having achieved actionless action, there
is nothing which is not done.” Now that we have become
active, if we wish to return to our original state, we will find it very difficult! Who but the great man could change
this?"
    -Chuang Tzu, translated by Martin Palmer, Chapter 22</p>

    <p>"Do not hanker for fame.
        Do not make plans.
        Do not try to do things.
        Do not try to master knowledge.
        Hold what is but do not hold it to be
        anything.
        Work with all that comes from Heaven, but
        do not seek to hold it.
        Just be empty.
        The perfect man’s heart is like a mirror. It does not search after things.
        It does not look for things.
        It does not seek knowledge, just responds.
        As a result he can handle everything and is
        not harmed by anything."
    -ibid, chapter 7</p>

    <p>A related idea is philosophical quietism:</p>

    <p>"Quietism in philosophy sees the role of philosophy as broadly therapeutic or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy. For quietists, advancing knowledge or settling debates (particularly those between realists and non-realists) is not the job of philosophy, rather philosophy should liberate the mind by diagnosing confusing concepts."
        -Wikipedia page on Philosophical Quietism
    </p>

    <p>Further, while Pyrrhonism has been criticized as self refuting when it goes to extremes, if we look at it more dialed back, and consider it a kind of quietism, rather than a positive thesis on relativism, knowledge, and so on, it can be much more palatable and useful:</p>

    <p>"Pyrrhonism represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus described Pyrrhonism as a form of philosophical therapy:"</p>

        <p>"The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of attaining ataraxia (being unperturbed). Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would attain ataraxia. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs."
       
        — Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 12</p>

        <p>Pyrhonnism was influenced by the Ajnana, and we can see that they had a similar approach:</p>
       
        <p>"I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that."
            -Digha Nikaya 1
        </p>

        <p> Of course both of these schools also ran wild with a lot of stuff that caused self refutation, but, so long as we stop there, and don't keep running, we've got a therapeutic, quietist position.</p>

        <p>Another interesting side note is that while many believe that Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka is a development of Buddhism, and that Pyrrho, too was influenced by Buddhism, when we analyze these schools we find that Madhyamaka sounds entirely distinc from the teachings of the historical Buddha recorded in the Pali Canon. We also find that Madhyamaka is very similar to the Ajnana teachings. With this in mind it is interesting to note that some scholars have found that the development may actually be exactly as it seems, rather than the counterintuitive assumption above:</p>

        <p>"Scholars including Barua, Jayatilleke, and Flintoff, contend that Pyrrho was influenced by, or at the very least agreed with, Indian scepticism rather than Buddhism or Jainism, based on the fact that he valued ataraxia, which can be translated as "freedom from worry". Jayatilleke, in particular, contends that Pyrrho may have been influenced by the first three schools of Ajñana, since they too valued freedom from worry. If this is true, then the methods of the Ajñanins may be preserved in the extant work by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus."
            -wikipedia page on Ajnana</p>

            <p>"Because of the high degree of similarity between Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism, Thomas McEvilley and Matthew Neale suspect that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India."
            -wikipedia page on Madhyamaka</p>
       
            <p>Thus, rather than the unlikely version in which the realist, rational Buddhism became the extremely skeptic, relativist Madhyamaka, which then influenced Pyrrho in creating his philosophy, the actual case was that Ajnana influenced Pyrrho, who influenced Nagarjuna and Madhyamaka. Traditional Buddhism is left out of the loop entirely. Indeed, it has no place in it, as traditional Buddhism had nothing but harsh words for the Ajnana philosophy, and by extension, would find deep fault in Pyrrhonism and Madhyamaka, were they around at the time.</p>

            <p>"In Brahmajala Sutta, this fourth school of Sceptics is described as thus:</p>

                <p>"Herein a certain recluse or brahmin is dull, stupid. And by reason of his dullness and stupidity, when questioned on this or that matter, he resorts to verbal jugglery or eel-wriggling: "If you ask me whether there is a next world, then if it were to occur to me (iti ce me assa) that there is a next world, I would pronounce that there is a next world. Yet, I do not say so, I do not say thus, I do not say otherwise, I do not say no, I deny the denials. Similarly with regard to the propositions, "there is no next world", "there is and is not a next world", "there neither is nor is not a next world", "there are beings who survive (death)", "there are no beings who survive", "there are and are no beings who survive", "there neither are nor are there no beings who survive", "there is a result and a consequence of good and evil actions", "there is no result or consequence of good or evil actions", "the Perfect One (Tathagato) exists after death", "the Perfect One does not exist after death", "the Perfect One both exists and does not exist after death", "the Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after death"</p>
               
                <p>"A similar account is given in the Samaññaphala Sutta. In both the accounts, the stupidity of this school is emphasised, highlighting the antipathy that the Buddhists felt about this school. In the Brahmajala Sutta, out of sixty-two philosophical schools mentioned, this school is singled out as being "a product of sheer stupidity;" whereas in the Samaññaphala Sutta, Ajatasattu singles out Sanjaya as "the most foolish and stupid."
